How do they address computational efficiency? ### Reference Text: Grammar induction has been studied extensively as part of natural language processing tasks such as syntactic analysis. In particular, recent works have focused on inducing mildly context-sensitive grammars which can capture more complex linguistic phenomena than traditional phrase structure grammars while still being amenable to efficient parsing algorithms. This paper presents a method for unsupervised discontinuous parsing based on the probabilistic Linear Context-Free Rewriting System (pLCF RS), where the goal is to learn parameters of the grammar without any annotated data. The authors fix the structural constraints of pLCF RS ahead of time but allow the probability distribution over possible parses to be learned via maximum likelihood estimation. They also introduce several optimizations aimed at improving scalability; specifically, by restricting attention to Binary pLCF RS (B-pLCF RS)—a variant allowing each production to involve at most 2 non-terminals—and discarding productions whose parsing would take too long due to their high computational cost. These modifications enable them to handle larger vocabularies and richer representations compared to previous approaches, leading to better performance on real-world languages like English, French, Spanish, etcetera. The key machine learning techniques used here include fixing the structural constraints upfront and optimizing through maximum likelihood estimation. Computational efficiency was addressed by limiting the scope to B-pLCF RS and pruning out costly operations during parsing. |# Based on the provided reference text, the specific type of machine learning technique described involves: 1. **Fixing Structural Constraints Upfront**: The researchers define fixed structural constraints within the framework of Probabilistic Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (pLCF RS). 2. **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**: Parameters of these predefined grammatical structures are optimized using MLE to fit the observed data without labeled annotations. To enhance computational efficiency, the following strategies were employed: 1. **Binary pLCF RS Restriction**: By focusing solely on Binary pLCF RS variants, wherein every production involves at most two non-terminal symbols, the model simplifies computations significantly. 2. **Pruning Costly Productions**: Certain productions requiring excessive computation times—specifically those involving higher-order interactions—are discarded, thereby streamlining the overall process. In summary, the primary ML technique utilized is Maximum Likelihood Estimation applied to pre-defined structural constraints derived from pLCF RS. Computationally, the methods focus on binary restrictions and strategic elimination of computationally expensive rules to ensure practical applicability across various natural languages. # Extracted Key Points Specific Machine Learning Technique: Fixing structural constraints upfront combined with optimization through Maximum Likelihood Estimation Addressing Computational Efficiency: - Restricted to Binary pLCF RS to limit non-terminal usage per production. - Discarded productions with high computational costs (>O(l^6)) to achieve O(l^5) parsing complexity. #"
