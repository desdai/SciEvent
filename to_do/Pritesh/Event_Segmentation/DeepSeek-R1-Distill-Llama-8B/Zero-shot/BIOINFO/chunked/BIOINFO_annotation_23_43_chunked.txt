    "abstract": "Pathway inference methods are important for annotating the genome, for providing insights into the mechanisms of biochemical processes and allow the discovery of signalling members and potential new drug targets. Here, we tested the hypothesis that genes with similar impact on cell viability across multiple cell lines belong to a common pathway, thus providing a conceptual basis for a pathway inference method based on correlated anti-proliferative gene properties. To test this concept, we used recently available large-scale RNAi screens to develop a method, termed functional pathway inference analysis (FPIA), to systemically identify correlated gene dependencies. To assess FPIA, we initially focused on PI3K/AKT/MTOR signalling, a prototypic oncogenic pathway for which we have a good sense of ground truth. Dependencies for AKT1, MTOR and PDPK1 were among the most correlated with those for PIK3CA (encoding PI3Kα), as returned by FPIA, whereas negative regulators of PI3K/AKT/MTOR signalling, such as PTEN were anti-correlated. Following FPIA, MTOR, PIK3CA and PIK3CB produced significantly greater correlations for genes in the PI3K-Akt pathway versus other pathways. Application of FPIA to two additional pathways (p53 and MAPK) returned expected associations (e.g., MDM2 and TP53BP1 for p53 and MAPK1 and BRAF for MEK1). Over-representation analysis of FPIA-returned genes enriched the respective pathway, and FPIA restricted to specific tumour lineages uncovered cell type-specific networks. Overall, our study demonstrates the ability of FPIA to identify members of pro-survival biochemical pathways in cancer cells.",

    "[Method]": "We developed a method called functional pathway inference analysis (FPIA) using data from recent large-scale RNAi screens to systematically identify correlated gene dependencies. Initially, we focused on the PI3K/AKT/MTOR signaling pathway, a well-understood oncogenic pathway, to validate FPIA.",
    "[Results]": "Using FPIA, we found that dependencies for AKT1, MTOR, and PDPK1 strongly correlated with those for PIK3CA (which encodes PI3Kα). Conversely, negative regulators like PTEN showed anti-correlations. Additionally, FPIA revealed stronger correlations within the PI3K-Akt pathway compared to other pathways. When applied to the p53 and MAPK pathways, FPIA also identified relevant interactions, such as MDM2 with TP53BP1 for p53 and MAPK1 with BRAF for MEK1.",
    "[Implications]": "The overrepresentation of FPIA-derived genes within specific pathways supports its validity. Furthermore, applying FPIA to particular tumor lineages can uncover cell-type-specific networks, highlighting its utility in targeted therapeutic approaches. This study demonstrates FPIA's effectiveness in identifying key components of survival pathways in cancer cells, offering valuable insights for drug development and personalized treatment strategies."

    "abstract": "Microbial secondary metabolites exhibit potential medicinal value. A large number of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in the human gut microbiome, which exhibit essential biological activity in microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions, have not been adequately characterized, making it difficult to prioritize these BGCs for experimental characterization. Here, we present the sBGC-hm, an atlas of secondary metabolite BGCs allows researchers to explore the potential therapeutic benefits of these natural products. One of its key features is the ability to assist in optimizing the BGC structure by utilizing the gene co-occurrence matrix obtained from Human Microbiome Project data.",
