    "abstract": "Among the remarkable emergent capabilities of large language models (LMs) is free-text rationalization; beyond certain scale, large LMs are capable of generating seemingly useful rationalizations, which in turn, can dramatically enhance their performances on leaderboards. This phenomenon raises a question: can machine generated rationales also be useful for humans, especially when lay humans try to answer questions based on those machine rationales? We observe that human utility of existing rationales is far from satisfactory and expensive to estimate with human studies. Existing metrics like task performance of the LM generating the rationales or similarity between generated and gold rationales are not good indicators of their human utility. While we observe that certain properties of rationales like conciseness and novelty are correlated with their human utility, estimating them without human involvement is challenging. We show that, by estimating a rationale’s helpfulness in answering similar unseen instances, we can measure its human utility to a better extent. We also translate this finding into an automated score, Gen-U, that we propose, which can help improve LMs’ ability to generate rationales with better human utility, while maintaining most of its task performance.",

    "abstract": "Using psycholinguistic and computational experiments we compare the ability of humans and several pre-trained masked language models to correctly identify control dependencies in Spanish sentences such as ‘José le prometió/ordenó a María ser ordenado/a’ (‘Joseph promised/ordered Mary to be tidy’). These structures underlie complex anaphoric and agreement relations at the interface of syntax and semantics, allowing us to study lexically-guided antecedent retrieval processes. Our results show that while humans correctly identify the (un)acceptability of the strings, language models often fail to identify the correct antecedent in non-adjacent dependencies, showing their reliance on linearity. Additional experiments on Galician reinforce these conclusions. Our findings are equally valuable for the evaluation of language models’ ability to capture linguistic generalizations, as well as for psycholinguistic theories of anaphor resolution.",

    "[Method]": "We conduct psycholinguistic experiments with human participants and computational experiments using pre-trained masked language models. The tasks involve identifying control dependencies in Spanish sentences, focusing on both acceptability judgments and antecedent identification. We also perform similar experiments on Galician to generalize our findings across languages.",
    "[Results]": "Humans successfully identify the acceptability of the strings but struggle with antecedent identification in non-adjacent dependencies, revealing their reliance on linear processing. Language models, however, frequently fail to identify the correct antecedent in such cases, highlighting their dependence on sequential information.",
    "[Implications]": "Our findings have significant implications for evaluating language models' capacity to grasp linguistic generalizations and for advancing psycholinguistic theories of anaphor resolution."
