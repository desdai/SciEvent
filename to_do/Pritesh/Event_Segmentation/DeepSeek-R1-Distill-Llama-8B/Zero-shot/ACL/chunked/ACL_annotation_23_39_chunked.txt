    "abstract": "We make decisions by reacting to changes in the real world, particularly the emergence and disappearance of impermanent entities such as restaurants, services, and events. Because we want to avoid missing out on opportunities or making fruitless actions after those entities have disappeared, it is important to know when entities disappear as early as possible. We thus tackle the task of detecting disappearing entities from microblogs where various information is shared timely. The major challenge is detecting uncertain contexts of disappearing entities from noisy microblog posts. To collect such disappearing contexts, we design time-sensitive distant supervision, which utilizes entities from the knowledge base and time-series posts. Using this method, we actually build large-scale Twitter datasets of disappearing entities. To ensure robust detection in noisy environments, we refine pretrained word embeddings for the detection model on microblog streams in a timely manner. Experimental results on the Twitter datasets confirmed the effectiveness of the collected labeled data and refined word embeddings; the proposed method outperformed a baseline in terms of accuracy, and more than 70% of the detected disappearing entities in Wikipedia are discovered earlier than the update on Wikipedia, with the average lead-time over one month.",
    "[Background]": "We make decisions by reacting to changes in the real world, particularly the emergence and disappearance of impermanent entities such as restaurants, services, and events.",
    "[Method]": "To detect disappearing entities from microblogs, we design time-sensitive distant supervision using entities from the knowledge base and time-series posts. This method allows us to build large-scale Twitter datasets of disappearing entities. Additionally, we refine pretrained word embeddings for the detection model by continuously updating them based on microblog streams.",
    "[Results]": "Experimental results show that our method outperforms a baseline in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, over one month, more than 70% of the detected disappearing entities appear in Wikipedia before its updates, with an average lead-time of one week.",
    "[Implications]": "The success of our approach highlights the importance of efficiently tracking and understanding transient entities across platforms like Twitter. This has significant implications for decision-making processes and could be extended to other domains requiring real-time entity monitoring."

    "abstract": "Weakly supervised vision-and-language pre-training (WVLP), which learns cross-modal representations with limited cross-modal supervision, has been shown to effectively reduce the data cost of pre-training while maintaining decent performance on downstream tasks. However, current WVLP methods use only local descriptions of images, i.e., object tags, as cross-modal anchors to construct weakly-aligned image-text pairs for pre-training. This affects the data quality and thus the effectiveness of pre-training. In this paper, we propose to directly take a small number of aligned image-text pairs as anchors, and represent each unaligned image and text by its similarities to these anchors, i.e., relative representations. We build a WVLP framework based on the relative representations, namely RELIT, which collects high-quality weakly-aligned image-text pairs from large-scale image-only and text-only data for pre-training through relative representation-based retrieval and generation. Experiments on four downstream tasks show that RELIT achieves new state-of-the-art results under the weakly supervised setting.",
    "[Background]": "Weakly supervised vision-and-language pre-training (WVLP) aims to reduce data costs while maintaining performance using limited cross-modal supervision. Current methods rely solely on local image descriptions like object tags, limiting pair quality and effectiveness.",
    "[Method]": "The proposed RELIT framework uses relative representations derived from a few aligned image-text pairs. It retrieves and generates high-quality weakly-aligned pairs from large-scale datasets via relative representation-based retrieval and generation.",
    "[Results]": "Experiments across four tasks demonstrate RELIT's superiority under weak supervision, achieving state-of-the-art results.",
    "[Implications]": "RELIT addresses key limitations in WVLP, offering improved efficiency and effectiveness for real-world applications."
