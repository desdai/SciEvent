    "abstract": "Is hierarchical XML apt for the encoding of complex manuscript materials? Some scholars have argued that texts are non-hierarchical entities and that XML therefore is inadequate. This paper argues that the nature of text is such that it supports both hierarchical and non-hierarchical representations. The paper distinguishes (1) texts from documents and document carriers, (2) writing from “texting”, (3) actions that can be performed by one agent only from actions that require at least two agents to come about (“shared actions”), (4) finite actions from potentially infinitely ongoing actions. Texts are described as potentially infinitely ongoing shared actions which are co-produced by author and reader agents. This makes texts into entities that are more akin to events than to objects or properties, and shows, moreover, that texts are dependent on human understanding and thus mind-dependent entities. One consequence from this is that text encoding needs to be recognized as an act participating in texting which in turn makes hierarchical XML as apt a markup for “text representation”, or rather: for texting, as non-hierarchical markup. The encoding practices of the Bergen Wittgenstein Archives (WAB) serve as the main touchstone for my discussion.",

    "abstract": "This article presents a case study of Kinolab, a digital platform for the analysis of narrative film language. It describes the need for a scholarly database of clips focusing on film language for cinema and media studies faculty and students, highlighting recent technological and legal advances that have created a favorable environment for this kind of digital humanities work. Discussion of the project is situated within the broader context of contemporary developments in moving image annotation and a discussion of the unique challenges posed by computationally-driven moving image analysis. The article also argues for a universally accepted data model for film language to facilitate the academic crowdsourcing of film clips and the sharing of research and resources across the Semantic Web.",

    "[Method]": "The article discusses the development of a digital platform called Kinolab designed for analyzing narrative film language. It emphasizes the creation of a scholarly database containing video clips related to film language studies for academia. Technological advancements and legal considerations are highlighted as factors enabling such digital humanities initiatives. The project is contextualized within current trends in moving image annotation and computational analysis techniques specific to moving images. A proposed universal data model for film language is introduced to support collaborative efforts in sourcing film clips and sharing research through the Semantic Web framework.",
    "[Results]": "Not explicitly provided in the given text.",
    "[Implications]": "The implications include enhancing academic collaboration through shared resources and standardized data models, facilitating access to film clip analyses, and advancing digital humanities projects involving moving image studies. Future directions may involve refining the proposed data model and expanding its adoption across various institutions and disciplines."
