      "abstract": "Developing biochemical models in systems biology is a complex, knowledge-intensive activity. Some modelers (especially novices) benefit from model development tools with a graphical user interface. However, as with the development of complex software, text-based representations of models provide many benefits for advanced model development. At present, the tools for text-based model development are limited, typically just a textual editor that provides features such as copy, paste, find, and replace. Since these tools are not 'model aware,' they do not provide features for: (i) model building such as autocompletion of species names; (ii) model analysis such as hover messages that provide information about chemical species; and (iii) model translation to convert between model representations. We refer to these as BAT features. We present VSCode-Antimony, a tool for building, analyzing, and translating models written in the Antimony modeling language, a human-readable representation of Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) models. VSCode-Antimony is a source editor, a tool with language-aware features. For example, there is autocompletion of variable names to assist with model building, hover messages that aid in model analysis, and translation between XML and Antimony representations of SBML models. These features result from making VSCode-Antimony model-aware by incorporating several sophisticated capabilities: analysis of the Antimony grammar (e.g., to identify model symbols and their types); a query system for accessing knowledge sources for chemical species and reactions; and automatic conversion between different model representations (e.g., between Antimony and SBML).",
