The common practice in implementing dynamic networks is to convert the given static layers into fully dynamic ones where all parameters are dynamic (at least within a single layer) and vary with the input. However, such a fully dynamic setting may cause redundant parameters and high deployment costs, limiting the applicability of dynamic networks to a broader range of tasks and models. The main contributions of our work are challenging the basic commonsense in dynamic networks and proposing a partially dynamic network, namely PAD-Net, to transform the redundant dynamic parameters into static ones. Also, we further design Iterative Mode Partition to partition dynamic and static parameters efficiently. Our method is comprehensively supported by large-scale experiments with two typical advanced dynamic architectures, i.e., DY-Conv and MoE, on both image classification and GLUE benchmarks. Encouragingly, we surpass the fully dynamic networks by +0.7% top-1 acc with only 30% dynamic parameters for ResNet-50 and +1.9% average score in language understanding with only 50% dynamic parameters for BERT.",

We take the first step by focusing on event commonsense that considers events and their relations, and is crucial in both dialogues and general commonsense reasoning. We propose ACCENT, an event commonsense evaluation metric empowered by commonsense knowledge bases (CSKBs). ACCENT first extracts event-relation tuples from a dialogue, and then evaluates the response by scoring the tuples in terms of their compatibility with the CSKB. To evaluate ACCENT, we construct the first public event commonsense evaluation dataset for open-domain dialogues.
