      "abstract": "Social media platforms are frequently used in health communication campaigns. Common understandings of campaign effects posit a sequential and linear series of steps from exposure to behavior change, commonly known as the hierarchy of effects model (HOE). These concepts need to be reevaluated in the age of social media, which are interactional and communal. This review aims to update the traditional HOE for health communication campaigns in the context of social media, including identifying indicators of effectiveness and how these are conceptualized to lead to health-related outcomes. We conducted a systematic review of studies following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines reporting on the use of social media as part of health communication campaigns, extracting campaign information such as objectives, platforms used, and measures of campaign performance. We used these data, combined with our understanding of the HOE, to develop an updated conceptual model of social media campaign effects. We identified 99 eligible studies reporting on 93 campaigns, published between 2012 and 2022. The campaigns were conducted in over 20 countries, but nearly half (n=42) were conducted in the United States. Campaigns targeted a variety of health issues and predominantly used Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. Most campaigns (n=81) set objectives targeting awareness or individual behavior change. Process measures (n=68; e.g., reach and impressions) and engagement measures (n=73; e.g., likes and retweets) were reported most frequently, while two-fifths (n=42) did not report any outcomes beyond engagement, such as changes in knowledge, behavior, or social norms. Most campaigns (n=55) collected measures that did not allow them to determine if the campaign objective had been met; that is, they were process evaluations only. Based on our review, our updated model suggests that campaign exposure can lead to individual behavior change and improved health outcomes, either through a direct or indirect pathway. Indirect pathways include exposure through social and policy changes. “Engagement” is positioned as critical to success, replacing awareness in the traditional HOE, and all types of engagement are treated as equal and good. No consideration is being given to potential negative engagement, such as the distribution of misinformation. Additionally, the process is no longer linear and sequential, with circular pathways evident, such as engagement not only influencing behavior change but also generating additional exposure to campaign messages. Our review has highlighted a change in conventional understandings of how campaigns can influence health outcomes in the age of social media. The updated model we propose provides social media campaigners with a starting point to develop and tailor campaign messages and allows evaluators to identify critical assumptions to test, including the role and value of “engagement.”",

Adequate assessment of pain, including procedural pain, which has short- and long-term consequences, is critical for its management. The introduction of mobile health–based (mHealth) pain assessment tools could address current challenges and is an area requiring further research. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy and feasibility aspects of PainChek Infant and, therefore, assess its applicability in the intended setting. By observing infants just before, during, and after immunization, we evaluated the accuracy and precision at different cutoff scores of PainChek Infant, which is a point-of-care mHealth–based solution that uses artificial intelligence to detect pain and intensity based solely on facial expression. We used receiver operator characteristic analysis to assess interpretability and establish a cutoff score. Clinician comprehensibility was evaluated using a standardized questionnaire. Other feasibility aspects were evaluated based on comparison with currently available observational pain assessment tools for use in infants with procedural pain. Both PainChek Infant Standard and Adaptive modes demonstrated high accuracy (area under the curve 0.964 and 0.966, respectively). At a cutoff score of ≥2, accuracy and precision were 0.908 and 0.912 for Standard and 0.912 and 0.897 for Adaptive modes, respectively. Currently available data allowed evaluation of 16 of the 17 feasibility aspects, with only the cost of the outcome measurement instrument unable to be evaluated since it is yet to be determined. PainChek Infant performed well across feasibility aspects, including interpretability (cutoff score defined), ease of administration, completion time (3 seconds), and clinician comprehensibility. This work provides information on the feasibility of using PainChek Infant in clinical practice for procedural pain assessment and monitoring, and demonstrates the accuracy and precision of the tool at the defined cutoff score.",
