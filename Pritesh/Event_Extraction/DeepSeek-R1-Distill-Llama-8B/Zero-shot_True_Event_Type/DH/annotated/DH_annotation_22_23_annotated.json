Teaching DH from the inside out — to computer scientists rather than humanists — has allowed us to see more clearly neglected areas of DH pedagogy that are in need of greater attention. Our experiences have shown us that if DH is to thrive as a field beyond traditional humanities departments in the U.S. and Europe, we need to better articulate and theorize the connections between humanities and computer scientific epistemologies. When teaching non-humanities students, in particular, we have found it necessary to pay more attention to humanities research methods and projects grounded in humanities research questions. In developing a curriculum that reflects our Singaporean context too, we have found that diversity in global DH should go beyond simply broadening DH’s cultural scope but must involve a more open and global engagement with computational, cultural research that may not identify disciplinarily as DH.",

Chun’s exploration of the predictive processes by which data analytics replicates 20th-century eugenics discourses makes an important contribution to the field of digital medical ethics and also offers unique insight into the mechanisms by which digital humanities scholars can disrupt and challenge the use and application of such predictive programs.",
