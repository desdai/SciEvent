      "abstract": "The annotation process of sign language corpora in terms of glosses, is a highly labor-intensive task, but a condition for a reliable quantitative analysis. During the annotation process the researcher typically defines the precise time slot in which a sign occurs and then enters the appropriate gloss for the sign. The aim of this project is to develop a set of tools to assist the annotation of the signs and their formal features in a video irrespectively of its content and quality. Recent advances in the field of deep learning have led to the development of accurate and fast pose estimation frameworks. In this study, such a framework (namely OpenPose) has been used to develop three different methods and tools to facilitate the annotation process. The first tool estimates the span of a sign sequence and creates empty slots in an annotation file. The second tool detects whether a sign is one- or two-handed. The last tool recognizes the different handshapes presented in a video sample. All tools can be easily re-trained to fit the needs of the researcher.",
