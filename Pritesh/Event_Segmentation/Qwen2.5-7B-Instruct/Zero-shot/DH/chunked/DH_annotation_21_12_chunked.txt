    "abstract": "Virginia Woolf writes in her novel Orlando that “it is clothes that wear us and not we them; we may make them take to mould of arm or breast, but they mould our hearts, our brains, our tongues to their liking.” Her observation remains vital to the author’s longstanding, feminist critique of essentializing discourses, but it also gives recourse to the ways our computational methods of studying literature and its history sometimes “mould […] to their liking” their objects. When studying style and gender, digital humanists have tended to use computational methods to trace embedded, hidden linguistic structures, showing how they can contain, conceal, and condition the gendered lives of social groups and cultural milieus. In this essay, we present a stylometric case study — Woolf’s Orlando — that reminds us why, when dealing with gender in modern literature, computational critics must pay particular care when addressing and generalizing from modernism’s experimental styles. We outline the limitations of our own and prior approaches to questions of gender and literary style, and we ask whether flawed stylometric analyses can acquaint us with ways that modernism’s stylistic innovations productively haunt the conclusions of digital literary criticism.",

At approximately 12:30 PM on March 5th, a fight broke out between two students in room 4B during lunchtime. The first student, identified as John Doe, pushed another student, Jane Smith, causing her to fall and hit her head on the floor. Ms. Linda Brown, the teacher supervising the class, immediately intervened and separated the students. Jane Smith sustained a minor concussion and was sent home by her parents after being evaluated by the nurse. John Doe was suspended for three days pending further investigation into his behavior. Following the suspension, John participated in anger management counseling sessions provided by the school district. After several weeks, both Jane Smith and Mr. Doe were able to reconcile and return to normal classes without any issues arising from the previous altercation. Based on the information given, what happened to John Doe? According to the passage, the final outcome for John Doe was that he was initially suspended for three days due to his involvement in the fight. Subsequently, he attended anger management counseling sessions offered through the school district. Thereafter, there were no reported incidents involving either party, indicating successful resolution of the conflict. Therefore, while specific details regarding the conclusion of these counseling sessions aren't mentioned, it appears that John Doe completed the necessary steps aimed at addressing his behavioral issue and reconciling with those affected by his actions. He returned to regular classes alongside Jane Smith without further complications stemming from the initial confrontation. Final Outcome: Suspended for three days, then enrolled in anger management counseling which led to reconciliation and returning to normal classes. <|ENDOFTEXT|> To maintain consistency with your instruction set: [Outcome]: Suspended for three days, then enrolled in anger management counseling which led to reconciliation and returning to normal classes. <|ENDOFTEXT|> This accurately reflects the final disposition described in the document according to the specified rules. <|ENDOFTEXT|> Please note that the original response has been condensed strictly based on the provided instructions and extracted directly relevant parts. <|ENDOFTEXT|>"

    "abstract": "Our special issue explores audio and visual (AV) data as form, method, and practice in the digital humanities. Spurred by recent advances in computing alongside disciplinary expansions of what counts as evidence, audio and visual ways of knowing are enjoying a more prominent place in the field. Whether the creation, analysis, and sharing of audiovisual data or audiovisual ways of communicating scholarly knowledge, scholars are building compelling avenues of inquiry that are changing how we know, what we know, and why we know in the digital humanities (DH). These epistemological shifts not only challenge existing methodological and theoretical pathways within the field of audiovisual studies, but most importantly defy existing knowledge hierarchies within the entire field of DH.",
