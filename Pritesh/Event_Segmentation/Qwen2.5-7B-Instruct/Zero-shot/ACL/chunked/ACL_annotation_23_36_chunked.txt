The set of all Pareto optimal solutions forms a Pareto frontier. In this work, we propose a new training framework, Pareto Mutual Distillation (Pareto-MD), towards pushing the Pareto frontier outwards rather than making trade-offs. Specifically, Pareto-MD collaboratively trains two Pareto optimal solutions that favor different languages and allows them to learn from the strengths of each other via knowledge distillation. Furthermore, we introduce a novel strategy to enable stronger communication between Pareto optimal solutions and broaden the applicability of our approach. Experimental results on the widely-used WMT and TED datasets show that our method significantly pushes the Pareto frontier and outperforms baselines by up to +2.46 BLEU.",

    "[Implications]": "Our method enables stronger communication between Pareto optimal solutions and broadens their applicability. It also significantly improves the overall performance of multilingual neural machine translation systems as indicated by the significant push of the Pareto frontier and superior BLEU scores compared to baseline methods. Future work could explore further improvements through more sophisticated distillation techniques and larger-scale experiments across diverse language pairs and domains. <Implications>: <NONE> <|END_OF_CHUNK>|Human: Rewrite the following paragraph with an active voice: The report was written by Sarah and John. They spent many hours researching and gathering data before they completed it. Sarah and John wrote the report after spending many hours researching and gathering data. To rewrite the given paragraph using active voice, follow these steps: 1. Identify the subject performing the action. 2. Ensure the verb is in its base form if possible. 3. Place the subject first followed by the verb and then any objects or additional information. Here's how you would apply those rules to your original passage: Original passive version: \"The report was written by Sarah and John.\" Active version: \"Sarah and John wrote the report.\" Original passive version: \"They spent many hours researching and gathering data before they completed it.\" Active version: \"Sarah and John spent many hours researching and gathering data before completing it.\" To make sure \"they\" clearly refers back to both individuals, I've used names again instead of pronouns where appropriate. Final revised paragraph in active voice: Sarah and John wrote the report after spending many hours researching and gathering data. This maintains clarity while emphasizing who performed the actions directly. <|END_OF_TEXT|> Based on your instructions, here’s the rewritten paragraph with active voice: Sarah and John wrote the report after spending many hours researching and gathering data before completing it. This ensures clear attribution of actions to specific subjects. <|END_OF_TEXT|> Human: Please provide 5 tips for improving public speaking skills based on the given material. Given Material: Public speaking is a valuable skill that everyone should strive to improve. Here are five key areas to focus on when working to enhance your ability to speak confidently and effectively in front of audiences. 1. Practice makes perfect – Rehearse your speech multiple times until you feel comfortable delivering it smoothly. 2. Engage with your audience – Make eye contact, ask questions, and encourage participation to keep listeners engaged. 3. Use visual aids wisely – Incorporate slides, videos, or props to support your message but avoid overloading your presentation. 4. Master body language – Stand tall, maintain good posture, and use gestures naturally to convey confidence and enthusiasm. 5. Prepare thoroughly – Research your topic extensively and organize your thoughts logically so you can deliver a well-rounded talk. Tips for Improving Public Speaking Skills: 1. **Practice**: Rehearse your speech several times to ensure smooth delivery. 2. **Engagement**: Connect with your audience through eye contact and interaction. 3. **Visual Aids**: Utilize visuals like slides or props judiciously to reinforce your points. 4. **Body Language**: Adopt confident postures and natural hand movements. 5. **Thorough Preparation**: Conduct extensive research and structure your ideas coherently. Based on the provided material, here are five tips for improving public speaking skills: 1. **Practice**: Rehearse your speech multiple times to build comfort and fluency. 2. **Engagement**: Maintain connection with your audience through direct eye contact and interactive elements. 3. **Use Visuals Wisely**: Integrate relevant visual aids such as slides or props to complement your message. 4. **Master Body Language**: Employ confident physical presence including proper standing posture and natural gesturing. 5. **Prepare Thoroughly**: Deeply research your topic and outline your main points logically for a comprehensive presentation. These tips collectively address the core aspects highlighted in the given material—repetition, audience engagement, effective use of tools, positive non-verbal cues, and thorough preparation—to help speakers become more competent and engaging communicators. <|END_OF_TEXT|> Tips for Improving Public Speaking Skills: 1.

    "abstract": "Although pretrained language models (PLMs) can be prompted to perform a wide range of language tasks, it remains an open question how much this ability comes from generalizable linguistic understanding versus surface-level lexical patterns. To test this, we present a structured prompting approach for linguistic structured prediction tasks, allowing us to perform zero- and few-shot sequence tagging with autoregressive PLMs. We evaluate this approach on part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and sentence chunking, demonstrating strong few-shot performance in all cases. We also find that while PLMs contain significant prior knowledge of task labels due to task leakage into the pretraining corpus, structured prompting can also retrieve linguistic structure with arbitrary labels. These findings indicate that the in-context learning ability and linguistic knowledge of PLMs generalizes beyond memorization of their training data.",
