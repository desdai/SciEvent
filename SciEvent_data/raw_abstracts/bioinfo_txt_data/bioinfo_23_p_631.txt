DCAlign is a new alignment method able to cope with the conservation and the co-evolution signals that characterize the columns of multiple sequence alignments of homologous sequences. However, the pre-processing steps required to align a candidate sequence are computationally demanding. We show in v1.0 how to dramatically reduce the overall computing time by including an empirical prior over an informative set of variables mirroring the presence of insertions and deletions.
