N-linked glycosylation is a frequently occurring post-translational protein modification that serves critical functions in protein folding, stability, trafficking, and recognition. Its involvement spans across multiple biological processes and alterations to this process can result in various diseases. Therefore, identifying N-linked glycosylation sites is imperative for comprehending the mechanisms and systems underlying glycosylation. Due to the inherent experimental complexities, machine learning and deep learning have become indispensable tools for predicting these sites. In this context, a new approach called EMNGly has been proposed. The EMNGly approach utilizes pretrained protein language model (Evolutionary Scale Modeling) and pretrained protein structure model (Inverse Folding Model) for features extraction and support vector machine for classification. Ten-fold cross-validation and independent tests show that this approach has outperformed existing techniques. And it achieves Matthews Correlation Coefficient, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.8282, 0.9343, 0.8934, and 0.9143, respectively on a benchmark independent test set.
