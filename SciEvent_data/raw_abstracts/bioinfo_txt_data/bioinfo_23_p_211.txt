The gene regulatory process resembles a logic system in which a target gene is regulated by a logic gate among its regulators. While various computational techniques are developed for a gene regulatory network (GRN) reconstruction, the study of logical relationships has received little attention. Here, we propose a novel tool called wpLogicNet that simultaneously infers both the directed GRN structures and logic gates among genes or transcription factors (TFs) that regulate their target genes, based on continuous steady-state gene expressions. wpLogicNet proposes a framework to infer the logic gates among any number of regulators, with a low time-complexity. This distinguishes wpLogicNet from the existing logic-based models that are limited to inferring the gate between two genes or TFs. Our method applies a Bayesian mixture model to estimate the likelihood of the target gene profile and to infer the logic gate a posteriori. Furthermore, in structure-aware mode, wpLogicNet reconstructs the logic gates in TF-gene or gene-gene interaction networks with known structures. The predicted logic gates are validated on simulated datasets of TF-gene interaction networks from Escherichia coli. For the directed-edge inference, the method is validated on datasets from E.coli and DREAM project. The results show that compared to other well-known methods, wpLogicNet is more precise in reconstructing the network and logical relationships among genes.
