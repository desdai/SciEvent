Single-cell DNA template strand sequencing (Strand-seq) allows a range of various genomic analysis including chromosome length haplotype phasing and structural variation (SV) calling in individual cells. Here, we present MosaiCatcher v2, a standardized workflow and reference framework for single-cell SV detection using Strand-seq. This framework introduces a range of functionalities, including: an automated upstream Quality Control (QC) and assembly sub-workflow that relies on multiple genome assemblies and incorporates a multistep normalization module, integration of the single-cell nucleosome occupancy and genetic variation analysis SV functional characterization and of the ArbiGent SV genotyping modules, platform portability, as well as a user-friendly and shareable web report. These new features of MosaiCatcher v2 enable reproducible computational processing of Strand-seq data, which are increasingly used in human genetics and single-cell genomics, toward production environments. MosaiCatcher v2 is compatible with both container and conda environments, ensuring reproducibility and robustness and positioning the framework as a cornerstone in computational processing of Strand-seq data.
