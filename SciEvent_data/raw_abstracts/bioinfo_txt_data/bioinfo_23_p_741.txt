The analysis of stable isotope labeling experiments requires accurate, efficient, and reproducible quantification of mass isotopomer distributions (MIDs), which is not a core feature of general-purpose metabolomics software tools that are optimized to quantify metabolite abundance. Here, we present PIRAMID (Program for Integration and Rapid Analysis of Mass Isotopomer Distributions), a MATLAB-based tool that addresses this need by offering a user-friendly, graphical user interface-driven program to automate the extraction of isotopic information from mass spectrometry (MS) datasets. This tool can simultaneously extract ion chromatograms for various metabolites from multiple data files in common vendor-agnostic file formats, locate chromatographic peaks based on a targeted list of characteristic ions and retention times, and integrate MIDs for each target ion. These MIDs can be corrected for natural isotopic background based on the user-defined molecular formula of each ion. PIRAMID offers support for datasets acquired from low- or high-resolution MS, and single (MS) or tandem (MS/MS) instruments. It also enables the analysis of single or dual labeling experiments using a variety of isotopes (i.e. 2H, 13C, 15N, 18O, 34S). DATA
