Preparing functional genomic (FG) data with diverse assay types and file formats for integration into analysis workflows that interpret genome-wide association and other studies is a significant and time-consuming challenge. Here we introduce hipFG (Harmonization and Integration Pipeline for Functional Genomics), an automatically customized pipeline for efficient and scalable normalization of heterogenous FG data collections into standardized, indexed, rapidly searchable analysis-ready datasets while accounting for FG datatypes (e.g. chromatin interactions, genomic intervals, quantitative trait loci).
