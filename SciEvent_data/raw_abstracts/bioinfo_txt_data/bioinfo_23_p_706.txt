The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database serves as a valuable systems biology resource and is widely utilized in diverse research fields. However, existing software does not allow flexible visualization and network analyses of the vast and complex KEGG data. We developed ggkegg, an R package that integrates KEGG information with ggplot2 and ggraph. ggkegg enables enhanced visualization and network analyses of KEGG data. We demonstrate the utility of the package by providing examples of its application in single-cell, bulk transcriptome, and microbiome analyses. ggkegg may empower researchers to analyze complex biological networks and present their results effectively.
