Fungi form a large and heterogeneous group of eukaryotic organisms with diverse ecological niches. The high importance of fungi contrasts with our limited understanding of fungal lifestyle and adaptability to environment. Over the last decade, the high-throughput sequencing technology produced tremendous RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data. However, there is no comprehensive database for mycologists to conveniently explore fungal gene expression and alternative splicing. Here, we have developed FungiExp, an online database including 35 821 curated RNA-seq samples derived from 220 fungal species, together with gene expression and alternative splicing profiles. It allows users to query and visualize gene expression and alternative splicing in the collected RNA-seq samples. Furthermore, FungiExp contains several online analysis tools, such as differential/specific, co-expression network and cross-species gene expression conservation analysis. Through these tools, users can obtain new insights by re-analyzing public RNA-seq data or upload personal data to co-analyze with public RNA-seq data.
