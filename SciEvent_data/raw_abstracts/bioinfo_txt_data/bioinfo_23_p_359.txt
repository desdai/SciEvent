As the resolution of metagenomic analysis increases, the evolution of microbial genomes in longitudinal metagenomic data has become a research focus. Some software has been developed for the simulation of complex microbial communities at the strain level. However, the tool for simulating within-strain evolutionary signals in longitudinal samples is still lacking. In this study, we introduce STEMSIM, a user-friendly command-line simulator of short-term evolutionary mutations for longitudinal metagenomic data. The input is simulated longitudinal raw sequencing reads of microbial communities or single species. The output is the modified reads with within-strain evolutionary mutations and the relevant information of these mutations. STEMSIM will be of great use for the evaluation of analytic tools that detect short-term evolutionary mutations in metagenomic data.
