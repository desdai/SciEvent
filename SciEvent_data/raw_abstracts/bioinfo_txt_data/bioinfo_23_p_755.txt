RNA molecules play crucial roles in various biological processes. They mediate their function mainly by interacting with other RNAs or proteins. At present, information about these interactions is distributed over different resources, often providing the data in simple tab-delimited formats that differ between the databases. There is no standardized data format that can capture the nature of all these different interactions in detail.
