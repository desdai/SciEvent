With the continued deluge of results from genome-wide association and functional genomic studies, it has become increasingly imperative to quickly combine and visualize different layers of genetic and genomic data within a given locus to facilitate exploratory and integrative data analyses. While several tools have been developed to visualize locus-level genetic results, the limited speed, scalability and flexibility of current approaches remain a significant bottleneck. Here, we present a Julia package for high-performance genetics and genomics-related data visualization that enables fast, simultaneous plotting of hundreds of association results along with multiple relevant genomic annotations. Leveraging the powerful plotting and layout utilities from Makie.jl facilitates the customization and extensibility of every component of a plot, enabling generation of publication-ready figures.
