Vaa3D is a software package that has been widely used to visualize and analyze multidimensional microscopic images in a number of cutting edge bioimage informatics applications. However, due to many recent updates of both software development environments and operating systems, it was highly requested to maintain Vaa3D and disseminate it on latest operating systems. In addition, there has never been a showcase about how to use Vaa3D's cross-platform visualization and immersive exploration functions for multidimensional and teravoxel-scale images. Here, we introduce a newly developed version of the software, called Vaa3D-x, to address all the above issues.
