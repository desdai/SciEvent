It has been observed in different kinds of networks, such as social or biological ones, a typical behavior inspired by the general principle 'similarity breeds connections'. These networks are defined as homophilic as nodes belonging to the same class preferentially interact with each other. In this work, we present HONTO (HOmophily Network TOol), a user-friendly open-source Python3 package designed to evaluate and analyze homophily in complex networks. The tool takes in input from the network along with a partition of its nodes into classes and yields a matrix whose entries are the homophily/heterophily z-score values. To complement the analysis, the tool also provides z-score values of nodes that do not interact with any other node of the same class. Homophily/heterophily z-scores values are presented as a heatmap allowing a visual at-a-glance interpretation of results.
