Virus mutation is one of the most important research issues which plays a critical role in disease progression and has prompted substantial scientific publications. Mutation extraction from published literature has become an increasingly important task, benefiting many downstream applications such as vaccine design and drug usage. However, most existing approaches have low performances in extracting virus mutation due to both lack of precise virus mutation information and their development based on human gene mutations. We developed ViMRT, a text-mining tool and search engine for automated virus mutation recognition using natural language processing. ViMRT mainly developed 8 optimized rules and 12 regular expressions based on a development dataset comprising 830 papers of 5 human severe disease-related viruses. It achieved higher performance than other tools in a test dataset (1662 papers, 99.17% in F1-score) and has been applied well to two other viruses, influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (212 papers, 96.99% in F1-score). These results indicate that ViMRT is a high-performance method for the extraction of virus mutation from the biomedical literature. Besides, we present a search engine for researchers to quickly find and accurately search virus mutation-related information including virus genes and related diseases.
