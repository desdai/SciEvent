The method of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and metabolomics combined provide an quantitative approach to pinpoint metabolic pathways and genes linked to specific diseases; however, such analyses require both genomics and metabolomics datasets from the same individuals/samples. In most cases, this approach is not feasible due to high costs, lack of technical infrastructure, unavailability of samples, and other factors. Therefore, an unmet need exists for a bioinformatics tool that can identify gene loci-associated polymorphic variants for metabolite alterations seen in disease states using standalone metabolomics. Here, we developed a bioinformatics tool, metGWAS 1.0, that integrates independent GWAS data from the GWAS database and standalone metabolomics data using a network-based systems biology approach to identify novel disease/trait-specific metabolite-gene associations. The tool was evaluated using standalone metabolomics datasets extracted from two metabolomics-GWAS case studies. It discovered both the observed and novel gene loci with known single nucleotide polymorphisms when compared to the original studies.
