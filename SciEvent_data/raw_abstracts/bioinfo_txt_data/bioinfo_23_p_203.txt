DeepPheWAS is an R package for phenome-wide association studies that creates clinically curated composite phenotypes and integrates quantitative phenotypes from primary care data, longitudinal trajectories of quantitative measures, disease progression and drug response phenotypes. Tools are provided for efficient analysis of association with any genetic input, under any genetic model, with optional sex-stratified analysis, and for developing novel phenotypes.
