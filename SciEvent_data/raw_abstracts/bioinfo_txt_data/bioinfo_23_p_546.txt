In recent years, a growing number of spatial epigenome datasets have been generated, presenting rich opportunities for studying the regulation mechanisms in solid tissue sections. However, visual exploration of these datasets requires extensive computational processing of raw data, presenting a challenge for researchers without advanced computational skills to fully explore and analyze such datasets. Here, we introduce AtlasXplore, a web-based platform that enables scientists to interactively navigate a growing collection of spatial epigenome data using an expanding set of tools.
