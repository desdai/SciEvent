The interpretation of pathway enrichment analysis results is frequently complicated by an overwhelming and redundant list of significantly affected pathways. Here, we present an R package aPEAR (Advanced Pathway Enrichment Analysis Representation) which leverages similarities between the pathway gene sets and represents them as a network of interconnected clusters. Each cluster is assigned a meaningful name that highlights the main biological themes in the experiment. Our approach enables an automated and objective overview of the data without manual and time-consuming parameter tweaking.
