Advances in 3D live cell microscopy are enabling high-resolution capture of previously unobserved processes. Unleashing the power of modern machine learning methods to fully benefit from these technologies is, however, frustrated by the difficulty of manually annotating 3D training data. MiCellAnnGELo virtual reality software offers an immersive environment for viewing and interacting with 4D microscopy data, including efficient tools for annotation. We present tools for labelling cell surfaces with a wide range of applications, including cell motility, endocytosis and transmembrane signalling.
