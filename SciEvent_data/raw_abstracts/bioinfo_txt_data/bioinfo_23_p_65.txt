Recently, an increasing number of methodological approaches have been proposed to tackle the complexity of metagenomics and microbiome data. In this scenario, reproducibility and replicability have become two critical issues, and the development of computational frameworks for the comparative evaluations of such methods is of utmost importance. Here, we present benchdamic, a Bioconductor package to benchmark methods for the identification of differentially abundant taxa.
