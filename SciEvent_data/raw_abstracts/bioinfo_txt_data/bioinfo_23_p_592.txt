Understanding drug-response differences in cancer treatments is one of the most challenging aspects of personalized medicine. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become state-of-the-art methods in many graph representation learning scenarios in bioinformatics. However, building an optimal handcrafted GNN model for a particular drug sensitivity dataset requires manual design and fine-tuning of the hyperparameters for the GNN model, which is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. In this work, we propose AutoCDRP, a novel framework for automated cancer drug-response predictor using GNNs. Our approach leverages surrogate modeling to efficiently search for the most effective GNN architecture. AutoCDRP uses a surrogate model to predict the performance of GNN architectures sampled from a search space, allowing it to select the optimal architecture based on evaluation performance. Hence, AutoCDRP can efficiently identify the optimal GNN architecture by exploring the performance of all GNN architectures in the search space. Through comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the GNN architecture generated by AutoCDRP surpasses state-of-the-art designs. Notably, the optimal GNN architecture identified by AutoCDRP consistently outperforms the best baseline architecture from the first epoch, providing further evidence of its effectiveness.
