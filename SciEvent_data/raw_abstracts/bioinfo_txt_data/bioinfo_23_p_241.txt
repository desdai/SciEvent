The investigation of sets of genes using biological pathways is a common task for researchers and is supported by a wide variety of software tools. This type of analysis generates hypotheses about the biological processes that are active or modulated in a specific experimental context. The Network Data Exchange Integrated Query (NDEx IQuery) is a new tool for network and pathway-based gene set interpretation that complements or extends existing resources. It combines novel sources of pathways, integration with Cytoscape, and the ability to store and share analysis results. The NDEx IQuery web application performs multiple gene set analyses based on diverse pathways and networks stored in NDEx. These include curated pathways from WikiPathways and SIGNOR, published pathway figures from the last 27 years, machine-assembled networks using the INDRA system, and the new NCI-PID v2.0, an updated version of the popular NCI Pathway Interaction Database. NDEx IQuery's integration with MSigDB and cBioPortal now provides pathway analysis in the context of these two resources.
