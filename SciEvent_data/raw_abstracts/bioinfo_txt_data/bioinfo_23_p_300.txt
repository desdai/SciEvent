This work is motivated by the problem of identifying homozygosity islands on the genome of individuals in a population. Our method directly tackles the issue of identification of the homozygosity islands at the population level, without the need of analysing single individuals and then combine the results, as is made nowadays in state-of-the-art approaches. We propose regularized offline change-point methods to detect changes in the parameters of a multidimensional distribution when we have several aligned, independent samples of fixed resolution. We present a penalized maximum likelihood approach that can be efficiently computed by a dynamic programming algorithm or approximated by a fast binary segmentation algorithm. Both estimators are shown to converge almost surely to the set of change-points without the need of specifying a priori the number of change-points. In simulation, we observed similar performances from the exact and greedy estimators. Moreover, we provide a new methodology for the selection of the regularization constant which has the advantage of being automatic, consistent, and less prone to subjective analysis.
