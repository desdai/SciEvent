The Local Disordered Region Sampling (LDRS, pronounced loaders) tool is a new module developed for IDPConformerGenerator, a previously validated approach to model intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). The IDPConformerGenerator LDRS module provides a method for generating all-atom conformations of intrinsically disordered protein regions at N- and C-termini of and in loops or linkers between folded regions of an existing protein structure. These disordered elements often lead to missing coordinates in experimental structures or low confidence in predicted structures. Requiring only a pre-existing PDB or mmCIF formatted structural template of the protein with missing coordinates or with predicted confidence scores and its full-length primary sequence, LDRS will automatically generate physically meaningful conformational ensembles of the missing flexible regions to complete the full-length protein. The capabilities of the LDRS tool of IDPConformerGenerator include modeling phosphorylation sites using enhanced Monte Carlo-Side Chain Entropy, transmembrane proteins within an all-atom bilayer, and multi-chain complexes. The modeling capacity of LDRS capitalizes on the modularity, the ability to be used as a library and via command-line, and the computational speed of the IDPConformerGenerator platform.
