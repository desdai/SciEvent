The UNited RESisdue (UNRES) package for coarse-grained simulations, which has recently been optimized to treat large protein systems, has been implemented on Graphical Processor Units (GPUs). An over 100-time speed-up of the GPU code (run on an NVIDIA A100) with respect to the sequential code and an 8.5 speed-up with respect to the parallel Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) code (run on 32 cores of 2 AMD EPYC 7313 Central Processor Units (CPUs)) has been achieved for large proteins (with size over 10 000 residues). Due to the averaging over the fine-grain degrees of freedom, 1 time unit of UNRES simulations is equivalent to about 1000 time units of laboratory time; therefore, millisecond time scale of large protein systems can be reached with the UNRES-GPU code.
