This article presents libRoadRunner 2.0, an extensible, high-performance, cross-platform, open-source software library for the simulation and analysis of models expressed using the systems biology markup language (SBML). libRoadRunner is a self-contained library, able to run either as a component inside other tools via its C++, C and Python APIs, or interactively through its Python or Julia interface. libRoadRunner uses a custom just-in-time (JIT) compiler built on the widely used LLVM JIT compiler framework. It compiles SBML-specified models directly into native machine code for a large variety of processors, making it fast enough to simulate extremely large models or repeated runs in reasonable timeframes. libRoadRunner is flexible, supporting the bulk of the SBML specification (except for delay and non-linear algebraic equations) as well as several SBML extensions such as hierarchical composition and probability distributions. It offers multiple deterministic and stochastic integrators, as well as tools for steady-state, sensitivity, stability and structural analyses.
