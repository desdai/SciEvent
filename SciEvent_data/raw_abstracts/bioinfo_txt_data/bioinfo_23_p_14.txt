The systems biology markup language (SBML) is an extensible standard format for exchanging biochemical models. One of the extensions for SBML is the SBML Layout and Render package. This allows modelers to describe a biochemical model as a pathway diagram. However, up to now, there has been little support to help users easily add and retrieve such information from SBML. In this application note, we describe a new Python package called SBMLDiagrams. This package allows a user to add a layout and render information or retrieve it using a straightforward Python API. The package uses skia-python to support the rendering of the diagrams, allowing export to commons formats such as PNG or PDF.
