We present YaHS, a user-friendly command-line tool for the construction of chromosome-scale scaffolds from Hi-C data. It can be run with a single-line command, requires minimal input from users (an assembly file and an alignment file) which is compatible with similar tools and provides assembly results in multiple formats, thereby enabling rapid, robust and scalable construction of high-quality genome assemblies with high accuracy and contiguity.
