The theoretical possibility of determining the state and parameters of a dynamic model by measuring its outputs is given by its structural identifiability and its observability. These properties should be analysed before attempting to calibrate a model, but their a priori analysis can be challenging, requiring symbolic calculations that often have a high computational cost. In recent years, a number of software tools have been developed for this task, mostly in the systems biology community. These tools have vastly different features and capabilities, and a critical assessment of their performance is still lacking. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the computational resources available for analysing structural identifiability. We consider 13 software tools developed in 7 programming languages and evaluate their performance using a set of 25 case studies created from 21 models. Our results reveal their strengths and weaknesses, provide guidelines for choosing the most appropriate tool for a given problem and highlight opportunities for future developments.
