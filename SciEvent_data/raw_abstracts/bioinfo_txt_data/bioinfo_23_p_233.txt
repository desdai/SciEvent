The confusion of acute inflammation infected by virus and bacteria or noninfectious inflammation will lead to missing the best therapy occasion resulting in poor prognoses. The diagnostic model based on host gene expression has been widely used to diagnose acute infections, but the clinical usage was hindered by the capability across different samples and cohorts due to the small sample size for signature training and discovery. Here, we construct a large-scale dataset integrating multiple host transcriptomic data and analyze it using a sophisticated strategy which removes batch effect and extracts the common information from different cohorts based on the relative expression alteration of gene pairs. We assemble 2680 samples across 16 cohorts and separately build gene pair signature (GPS) for bacterial, viral, and noninfected patients. The three GPSs are further assembled into an antibiotic decision model (bacterial-viral-noninfected GPS, bvnGPS) using multiclass neural networks, which is able to determine whether a patient is bacterial infected, viral infected, or noninfected. bvnGPS can distinguish bacterial infection with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.953 (95% confidence interval, 0.948-0.958) and viral infection with AUC of 0.956 (0.951-0.961) in the test set (N = 760). In the validation set (N = 147), bvnGPS also shows strong performance by attaining an AUC of 0.988 (0.978-0.998) on bacterial-versus-other and an AUC of 0.994 (0.984-1.000) on viral-versus-other. bvnGPS has the potential to be used in clinical practice and the proposed procedure provides insight into data integration, feature selection and multiclass classification for host transcriptomics data.
