Imaging-based spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies have achieved subcellular resolution, enabling detection of individual molecules in their native tissue context. Data associated with these technologies promise unprecedented opportunity toward understanding cellular and subcellular biology. However, in R/Bioconductor, there is a scarcity of existing computational infrastructure to represent such data, and particularly to summarize and transform it for existing widely adopted computational tools in single-cell transcriptomics analysis, including SingleCellExperiment and SpatialExperiment (SPE) classes. With the emergence of several commercial offerings of imaging-based ST, there is a pressing need to develop consistent data structure standards for these technologies at the individual molecule-level. To this end, we have developed MoleculeExperiment, an R/Bioconductor package, which (i) stores molecule and cell segmentation boundary information at the molecule-level, (ii) standardizes this molecule-level information across different imaging-based ST technologies, including 10Ã— Genomics' Xenium, and (iii) streamlines transition from a MoleculeExperiment object to a SpatialExperiment object. Overall, MoleculeExperiment is generally applicable as a data infrastructure class for consistent analysis of molecule-resolved spatial omics data.
