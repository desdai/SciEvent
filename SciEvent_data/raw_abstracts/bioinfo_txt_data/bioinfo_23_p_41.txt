Light-field microscopy (LFM) is a compact solution to high-speed 3D fluorescence imaging. Usually, we need to do 3D deconvolution to the captured raw data. Although there are deep neural network methods that can accelerate the reconstruction process, the model is not universally applicable for all system parameters. Here, we develop AutoDeconJ, a GPU-accelerated ImageJ plugin for 4.4Ã— faster and more accurate deconvolution of LFM data. We further propose an image quality metric for the deconvolution process, aiding in automatically determining the optimal number of iterations with higher reconstruction accuracy and fewer artifacts. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art light-field deconvolution methods in reconstruction time and optimal iteration numbers prediction capability. It shows better universality of different light-field point spread function (PSF) parameters than the deep learning method. The fast, accurate and general reconstruction performance for different PSF parameters suggests its potential for mass 3D reconstruction of LFM data.
