mpwR is an R package for a standardized comparison of mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic label-free workflows recorded by data-dependent or data-independent spectral acquisition. The user-friendly design allows easy access to compare the influence of sample preparation procedures, combinations of liquid chromatography (LC)-MS setups, as well as intra- and inter-software differences on critical performance measures across an unlimited number of analyses. mpwR supports outputs of commonly used software for bottom-up proteomics, such as ProteomeDiscoverer, Spectronaut, MaxQuant, and DIA-NN.
