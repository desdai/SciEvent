Bloom filters are a popular data structure that allows rapid searches in large sequence datasets. So far, all tools work with nucleotide sequences; however, protein sequences are conserved over longer evolutionary distances, and only mutations on the protein level may have any functional significance. We present MetaProFi, a Bloom filter-based tool that, for the first time, offers the functionality to build indexes of amino acid sequences and query them with both amino acid and nucleotide sequences, thus bringing sequence comparison to the biologically relevant protein level. MetaProFi implements additional efficient engineering solutions, such as a shared memory system, chunked data storage and efficient compression. In addition to its conceptual novelty, MetaProFi demonstrates state-of-the-art performance and excellent memory consumption-to-speed ratio when applied to various large datasets.
