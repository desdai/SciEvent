Digital tools have potential to support collaborative management of mental health conditions, but we need to better understand how to integrate them in routine healthcare, particularly for patients with both physical and mental health needs. We therefore conducted interviews and design workshops with 1) a group of care managers who support patients with complex health needs, and 2) their patients whose health needs include mental health concerns. We investigate both groups' views of potential applications of digital tools within care management. Findings suggest that care managers felt underprepared to play an ongoing role in addressing mental health issues and had concerns about the burden and ambiguity of providing support through new digital channels. In contrast, patients envisioned benefiting from ongoing mental health support from care managers, including support in using digital tools. Patients' and care managers' needs may diverge such that meeting both through the same tools presents a significant challenge. We discuss how successful design and integration of digital tools into care management would require reconceptualizing these professionals' roles in mental health support.
