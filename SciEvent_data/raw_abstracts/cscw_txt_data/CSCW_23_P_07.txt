Socially assistive robots can support people in making behavior changes by socially engaging in or moderating certain behaviors, such as physical exercise and snacking. However, there has not been much work on designing social robots that aim to support both social engagement and behavior moderation, i.e., offering social interactions for engaging in behaviors without over-engagement. This work explores how social robots can moderate alcohol consumption while socially engaging them in a solitary drinking context. As alcohol consumption can have benefits when done in moderation, this companion robot aims to guide the user toward moderate drinking by using social engagement (i.e., creating an enjoyable atmosphere) and drinking moderation (i.e., regulating the drinking pace). Our preliminary user study (n=20) reveals that the robot is perceived as a friendly companion, and its human-likeness is partly attributed to the robot's intervention. Most participants followed the robot's guidance and perceived it as an intelligent friend due to its social interactions and behavior tracking features. We discuss the benefit of physical interactions for social engagement, utilizing interaction rituals for enjoyable but moderate commensality, and ethical considerations in solitary drinking contexts.
