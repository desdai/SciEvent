As AI-mediated communication (AI-MC) becomes more prevalent in everyday interactions, it becomes increasingly important to develop a rigorous understanding of its effects on interpersonal relationships and on society at large. Controlled experimental studies offer a key means of developing such an understanding, but various complexities make it difficult for experimental AI-MC research to simultaneously achieve the criteria of experimental realism, experimental control, and scalability. After outlining these methodological challenges, this paper offers the concept of methodological middle spaces as a means to address these challenges. This concept suggests that the key to simultaneously achieving all three of these criteria is to abandon the perfect attainment of any single criterion. This concept's utility is demonstrated via its use to guide the design of a platform for conducting text-based AI-MC experiments. Through a series of three example studies, the paper illustrates how the concept of methodological middle spaces can inform the design of specific experimental methods. Doing so enabled these studies to examine research questions that would have been either difficult or impossible to investigate using existing approaches. The paper concludes by describing how future research could similarly apply the concept of methodological middle spaces to expand methodological possibilities for AI-MC research in ways that enable contributions not currently possible.
