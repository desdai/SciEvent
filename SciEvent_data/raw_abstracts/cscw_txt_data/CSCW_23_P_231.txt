Hurricanes can cause catastrophic damage; it is critical for those affected to access information about conditions, loved ones, and resources. Prior work in the HCI and CSCW communities has focused on how social media can be vital during natural disasters; non-social media technologies have been under-researched. To understand how technology other than social media can support or harm people during crises, we explore hurricane survivors' use and disuse of multiple kinds of technologies in online surveys with 138 US participants. We find substantial technology use supporting survivors' comfort and safety other than social media. We also observe that designing technologies for high-resource environments--as with many mainstream apps--causes users to decrease use of potentially critical technologies during utility outages, which are common during hurricanes. With themes of both (a) broad technology use and (b) conditions preventing technology use, we make recommendations for technical design, policy, and research to empower communities susceptible to hurricanes.
