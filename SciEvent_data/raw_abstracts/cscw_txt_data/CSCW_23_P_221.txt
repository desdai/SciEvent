Long-term behaviour change for adolescents plays an important role in improving the adolescent's future health. However, long-term behaviour changes are rarely sustained. This study aims to inform human-computer interaction researchers of the current state of research regarding the designing of technology-enabled interventions for sustaining behaviour change for adolescents, as well as provide recommendations for future research directions. Through a scoping review, 22 interventions were identified and analysed to report the behaviour change strategies, characteristics, levels of influence, and formats of technology used, as well as the frameworks used to develop these interventions. Based on the review's findings, three research gaps were identified: (1) the exploration of approaches to restructuring the environment; (2) the exploration of the effects of varying levels of social interactivity between people; and (3) the development of frameworks for building interventions.
