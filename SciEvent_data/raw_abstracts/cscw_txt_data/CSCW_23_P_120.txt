Conversational agents are widely used in today's multi-channel service environments. However, little is known regarding the challenges faced by user experience (UX) designers. This study explores the challenges faced by conversational UX designers working in multidisciplinary teams for understanding the design process involved in the transformation of conventional graphical interfaces to conversation flows. In-depth interviews with UX designers working in industries reveal the key challenges in the form-to-flow transformation process. Moreover, collaborative work with various stakeholders in complex work environments involves conversational artificial intelligence-engendered gap-filling work phenomena wherein UX designers tend to work across role boundaries. Our results indicate the need for added support for CUX designer including tools and guidelines to suppport form-to-flow design, tools for testing, and defining extended roles for CUX designers with collaborative perspectives for designing conversational agents in multi-channel service environments.
