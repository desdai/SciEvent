Human-AI teams are increasingly prevalent in various domains. We investigate how the decision-making of a team member in a human-AI team impacts the outcome of the collaboration and perceived team-efficacy. In a large scale study on Mechanical Turk (n=125), we find significant differences across different decision making styles and disclosed AI identity disclosure in an AI-driven collaborative game. We find that autocratic decision-making negatively impacts team-efficacy in Human-AI teams, similar to its effects on human-only teams. We find that decision making style and AI-identity disclosure impacts how individuals make decisions in a collaborative context. We discuss our findings of the differences of collaborative behavior in human-human-AI teams and human-AI-AI teams.
