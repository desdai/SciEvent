Cesarean section (CS) delivery rate has increased significantly both globally and in India, thereby posing a burden on overstretched health systems. This study plans to understand the factors associated with CS rate with an objective to (1) analyze the trends of CS delivery from 1998-99 to 2019-21 and (2) understand the proximate determinants of CS deliveries in India. Analysis of secondary data (National Family Health Survey) of a nationally representative sample of 230,870 women (year 2019-21) was undertaken to explore the trends, distribution, and determinants of CS deliveries in India and within states. Multivariable analyses were performed to determine the proximate variables associated with CS and elective CS. The relative interaction effect of confounding factors, such as number of antenatal care (ANC) visits, place of residence, and wealth status, on cesarean delivery was assessed. A composite index was generated using trust, support, and intimate partner violence variables (termed the partner human capital index [PHI]) to study its influence on CS deliveries, with a low PHI indicating abusive partner and a high PHI indicating supportive partner. Statewise spatial distribution of the most significantly associated factors, namely, wealth quintile and ANC checkups, were also analyzed. The overall prevalence of CS was 21.50% (49,634/230,870) which had risen from 16.72% (2312/13,829) in 1998-99. The adjusted odds of CS deliveries were significantly higher among women who were highly educated (odds ratio [OR] 7.30, 95% CI 7.02-7.60;P<.001), had 4 or more ANC visits (OR 2.28, 95% CI 2.15-2.42;P<.001), belonging to the high-wealth quintile (OR 7.87, 95% CI 7.57-8.18;P<.001), and from urban regions. Increasing educational level of the head of the household (OR 3.05, 95% CI 2.94-3.16;P<.001) was also found to be a significant determinant of CS deliveries. The odds of selection of elective and emergency CS were also significantly higher among women from richer families (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.25-2.21;P<.001) and those belonging to Christian religion (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.14-2.43;P=.008). Adjusting the cesarean delivery by PHI, the odds of outcome were significantly higher among women with moderate and high PHI compared with those with low PHI (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.36-1.56 and OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.49-1.74, respectively;P<.001 for both). The interaction effect result reiterates that women with more than 4 ANC checkups, high PHI, and belonging to the richer wealth quintile were more likely to undergo cesarean delivery (OR 22.22, 95% CI 14.99-32.93;P<.001) compared with those with no ANC visit, low PHI, and poorest women. The increasing trend of CS deliveries across India is raising concerns. Better education, wealth, and good support from the partner have been incriminated as the contributory factors. There is a need to institute proper monitoring mechanisms to assess the need for CS, especially when performed electively.
