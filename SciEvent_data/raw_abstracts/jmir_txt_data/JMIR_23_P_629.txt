Older patients are at an increased risk of malnutrition due to many factors related to poor clinical outcomes. This study aims to develop an assisted diagnosis model using machine learning (ML) for identifying older patients with malnutrition and providing the focus of individualized treatment. We reanalyzed a multicenter, observational cohort study including 2660 older patients. Baseline malnutrition was defined using the global leadership initiative on malnutrition (GLIM) criteria, and the study population was randomly divided into a derivation group (2128/2660, 80%) and a validation group (532/2660, 20%). We applied 5 ML algorithms and further explored the relationship between features and the risk of malnutrition by using the Shapley additive explanations visualization method. The proposed ML models were capable to identify older patients with malnutrition. In the external validation cohort, the top 3 models by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were light gradient boosting machine (92.1%), extreme gradient boosting (91.9%), and the random forest model (91.5%). Additionally, the analysis of the importance of features revealed that BMI, weight loss, and calf circumference were the strongest predictors to affect GLIM. A BMI of below 21 kg/m2 was associated with a higher risk of GLIM in older people. We developed ML models for assisting diagnosis of malnutrition based on the GLIM criteria. The cutoff values of laboratory tests generated by Shapley additive explanations could provide references for the identification of malnutrition.
