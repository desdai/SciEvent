While mobile health apps have demonstrated their potential in revolutionizing health behavior changes, the impact of a mobile community built on these apps on the level of physical activity and mental well-being in cancer survivors remains unexplored. In this randomized controlled trial, we examine the effects of participation in a mobile health community specifically designed for breast cancer survivors on their physical activity levels and mental distress. We performed a single-center, randomized, parallel-group, open-label, controlled trial. This trial enrolled women between 20 and 60 years of age with stage 0 to III breast cancer, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0, and the capability of using their own smartphone apps. From January 7, 2019, to April 17, 2020, a total of 2,616 patients were consecutively screened for eligibility after breast cancer surgery. Overall, 202 patients were enrolled in this trial, and 186 patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either the intervention group (engagement in a mobile peer support community using an app for tracking steps; n=93) or the control group (using the app for step tracking only; n=93) with a block size of 10 without stratification. The mobile app provides a visual interface of daily step counts, while the community function also provides rankings among its members and regular notifications encouraging physical activity. The primary end point was the rate of moderate to severe distress for the 24-week study period, measured through an app-based survey using the Distress Thermometer. The secondary end point was the total weekly steps during the 24-week period. After excluding dropouts, 85 patients in the intervention group and 90 patients in the control group were included in the analysis. Multivariate analyses showed that patients in the intervention group had a significantly lower degree of moderate to severe distress (B=–0.558; odds ratio 0.572;P<.001) and a higher number of total weekly step counts (B=0.125; rate ratio 1.132;P<.001) during the 24-week period. Engagement in a mobile app–based patient community was effective in reducing mental distress and increasing physical activity in breast cancer survivors.
