The advantages of multimodal digitally transformed mobile health management for patients diagnosed with mild to moderate hypertension are not yet established. We aim to evaluate the therapeutic benefits of a novel WeChat-based multimodal digital transforming management model in mobile health blood pressure (BP) management. This randomized controlled clinical trial included 175 individuals with new-onset mild to moderate hypertension who were admitted to our center between September and October 2022. The patients were randomly assigned to either the multimodal intervention group (n=88) or the usual care group (n=87). The primary composite outcome was home and office BP differences after 6 months. The major secondary outcomes were 6-month quality-of-life scores, including the self-rating anxiety scale, self-rating depression scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The mean home BP decreased from 151.74 (SD 8.02)/94.22 (SD 9.32) to 126.19 (SD 8.45)/82.28 (SD 9.26) mm Hg in the multimodal intervention group and from 150.78 (SD 7.87)/91.53 (SD 9.78) to 133.48 (SD 10.86)/84.45 (SD 9.19) mm Hg in the usual care group, with a mean difference in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure of –8.25 mm Hg (95% CI –11.71 to –4.78 mm Hg;P<.001) and –4.85 mm Hg (95% CI –8.41 to –1.30 mm Hg;P=.008), respectively. The mean office BP decreased from 153.64 (SD 8.39)/93.56 (SD 8.45) to 127.81 (SD 8.04)/ 82.16 (SD 8.06) mm Hg in the multimodal intervention group and from 151.48 (SD 7.14)/(91.31 (SD 9.61) to 134.92 (SD 10.11)/85.09 (SD 8.26) mm Hg in the usual care group, with a mean difference in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure of –9.27 mm Hg (95% CI –12.62 to –5.91 mm Hg;P<.001) and –5.18 mm Hg (95% CI –8.47 to –1.89 mm Hg;P=.002), respectively. From baseline to 6 months, home BP control <140/90 mm Hg was achieved in 64 (72.7%) patients in the multimodal intervention group and 46 (52.9%) patients in the usual care group (P=.007). Meanwhile, home BP control <130/80 mm Hg was achieved in 32 (36.4%) patients in the multimodal intervention group and 16 (18.4%) patients in the usual care group (P=.008). After 6 months, there were significant differences in the quality-of-life total and graded scores, including self-rating anxiety scale scores (P=.04), self-rating depression scale scores (P=.03), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores (P<.001), in the multimodal intervention group compared with the usual care group. The WeChat-based multimodal intervention model improved the BP control rates and lowered the BP levels more than the usual care approach. The multimodal digital transforming management model for hypertension represents an emerging medical practice that utilizes the individual’s various risk factor profiles for primary care and personalized therapy decision-making in patients with hypertension.
