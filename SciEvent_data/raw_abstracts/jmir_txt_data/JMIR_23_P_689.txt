Internet use is an important means of accessing health-related information. Identifying the associations between internet use and health outcomes could provide insight into strategies for improving public health among middle-aged and older adults (45 years and up). This study aimed to examine the relationship between internet use and health outcomes in middle-aged and older adults. Data were obtained from the 2018 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. Physical, mental, and subjective health were assessed using the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Scale, the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and the 3-level Self-Rated Health Scale, respectively. The chi-square test and rank sum test were used to explore whether internet use was associated with health status. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine this association further after controlling for the confounding factors. Overall, 13% (1752/13,474) of the participants used the internet. Regression analyses revealed that the prevalence of depression (odds ratio [OR] 0.59, 95% CI 0.52-0.68;P<.001), negative self-rated health (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.61-0.76;P<.001), and difficulty with ADL (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.39-0.60;P<.001) in the participating middle-aged and older adult was lower in those using the internet than nonusers. After controlling for confounding factors, internet use was found to be negatively associated with difficulty with ADL (urban: OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.32-0.61;P<.001 vs rural: OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.41-0.75;P<.001), depression (urban: OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.57-0.84;P<.001 vs rural: OR 0.52, 95% CI: 0.43-0.63;P<.001), and self-rated health status (urban: OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.61-0.81;P<.001 vs rural: OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.57-0.78;P<.001) among middle-aged and older adults in both urban and rural areas. Internet use had a positive effect on the physical and mental health of middle-aged and older adults who participated in this study. However, the internet usage rate remains low among older Chinese people. Therefore, the internet penetration rate should be a priority.
