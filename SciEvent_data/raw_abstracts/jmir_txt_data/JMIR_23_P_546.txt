The rapidly increasing role of the internet in obtaining basic services poses challenges, especially for older adults’ capabilities of getting the services they need. Research on the predictors of older adults’ internet use and digital competence is especially relevant given that people are living longer than before, and the age profile of many societies is changing rapidly. We aimed to examine the associations of objective measures of physical and cognitive impairment with the nonuse of the internet for services and low digital competence among older adults. A longitudinal population-based design was used that combined data from performance tests and self-rated questionnaires. Data were gathered in 2017 and 2020 among 1426 older adults aged between 70 and 100 years in Finland. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the associations. Those who had poor near (odds ratio [OR] 1.90, 95% CI 1.36-2.66) or distant vision (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.21-2.71), restricted or failed abduction of upper arms (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.28-2.85), and poor results from the word list memory (OR 3.77, 95% CI 2.65-5.36) or word list delayed recall (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.48-3.02) tests had greater odds for nonuse of the internet for services than their counterparts. Moreover, those who had poor near (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.57-3.02) or distant vision (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.43-3.19), poor results from the chair stand test (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.06-2.31), restricted or failed abduction of upper arms (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.10-2.76), and poor results from the word list memory (OR 3.41, 95% CI 2.32-5.03) or word list delayed recall (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.39-3.04) tests had greater odds of low digital competence than their counterparts. According to our results, older adults’ impaired physical and cognitive functioning may hamper their possibilities of accessing internet services such as digital health care services. Our results should be considered when planning digital health care services intended to be used by older adults; that is, digital solutions should also be suitable for older adults with impairments. Furthermore, face-to-face services should be provided for those who cannot use digital services, even if they are assisted properly.
