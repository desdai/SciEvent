Midcareer women physicians face numerous obstacles to career advancement and leadership roles resulting in their contributions and achievements becoming “invisible.” This paper addresses the paradox of increasing professional experience coupled with decreased visibility for women in medicine at this stage in their careers. To address this disparity, the Women in Medicine Leadership Accelerator has developed a leadership skill development program specifically tailored for midcareer women physicians. The program incorporates key principles derived from effective leadership training models and aims to combat systemic barriers while equipping women with the necessary tools to navigate and transform the medical leadership landscape.
