The eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) was introduced in China in 2013 as one of the most important electronic health literacy measurement instruments. After a decade of development in China, it has received widespread attention, although its theoretical underpinnings have been challenged, thus demanding more robust research evidence of factorial validity and multigroup measurement properties. This study aimed to evaluate the Chinese version of the eHEALS in terms of its measurement properties. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in a university setting in China. Item statistics were checked for response distributions and floor and ceiling effects. Internal consistency reliability was confirmed with Cronbach α, split-half reliability, Cronbach α if an item was deleted, and item-total correlation. A total of 5 representative eHEALS factor structures were examined and contrasted using confirmatory factor analysis. The study used the item-level content validity index (I-CVI) and the average of the I-CVI scores of all items on the scale to assess the content validity of the dominance model. Furthermore, the validated dominance model was subsequently used to evaluate the relevance and representation of elements in the instrument and to assess measurement invariance across genders. A total of 972 respondents were identified, with a Cronbach α of .92, split-half reliability of 0.88, and item-total score correlation coefficients ranging from 0.715 to 0.781. Cronbach α if an item was deleted showed that all items should be retained. Acceptable content validity was supported by I-CVIs ≥0.80. The confirmatory factor analysis confirmed that the 3-factor model was acceptable. The measurement model met all relevant fit indices: average variance extracted from 0.663 to 0.680, composite reliability from 0.810 to 0.857, chi-square divided by thedfof 4.768, root mean square error of approximation of 0.062, standardized root mean squared residual of 0.020, comparative fit index (CFI) of 0.987, and Tucker-Lewis index of 0.979. In addition, the scale demonstrated error variance invariance (Δnormed fit index=−0.016, Δincremental fit index=−0.012, ΔTucker-Lewis index=0.005, Δcomparative fit index=−0.012, Δrelative fit index=0.005, and Δroot mean square error of approximation=0.005). A 3-factor model of the Chinese version of the eHEALS fits best, and our findings provide evidence for the strict measurement invariance of the instrument regarding gender.
