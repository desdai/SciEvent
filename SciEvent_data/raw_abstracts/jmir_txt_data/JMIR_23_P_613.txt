The practical training course of internal medicine of traditional Chinese medicine (PTC-IMTCM) is primarily based on traditional case teaching, which can be stressful for teachers. The use of virtual standardized patient (VSP) applications could be an alternative; however, there is limited evidence regarding their feasibility and effectiveness. This study aimed to build a VSP-TCM application according to the characteristics of PTC-IMTCM and the needs of students and to compare its efficacy with that of traditional teaching in improving TCM clinical competence among students. A prequestionnaire investigation was conducted before the course, and a VSP-TCM system was developed based on the results of the questionnaire. A randomized controlled trial was then conducted between February 26, 2020, and August 20, 2021. A total of 84 medical students were included and were divided into 2 groups: an observation group, trained with VSP-TCM (n=42, 50%), and a control group, trained with traditional academic training (n=42, 50%). Formative and summative assessments were conducted to evaluate teaching effectiveness. After completing the course, the students were administered a questionnaire to self-assess their satisfaction with the course. A questionnaire was also administered to 15 teachers to uncover their perspectives on VSP-TCM. All participants completed the study. In the formative assessment, the VSP-TCM group performed better in medical interviewing ability (mean 7.19, SD 0.63, vs mean 6.83, SD 0.81;P=.04), clinical judgment (mean 6.48, SD 0.98, vs mean 5.86, SD 1.04;P=.006), and comprehensive ability (mean 6.71, SD 0.59, vs mean 6.40, SD 0.58;P=.02) than the control group. Similarly, in the summative evaluation, the VSP-TCM group performed better in the online systematic knowledge test (OSKT; mean 86.62, SD 2.71, vs mean 85.38, SD 2.62;P=.046), application of TCM technology (mean 87.86, SD 3.04, vs mean 86.19, SD 3.08;P=.02), TCM syndrome differentiation and therapeutic regimen (mean 90.93, SD 2.42, vs mean 89.60, SD 2.86;P=.03), and communication skills (mean 90.67, SD 4.52, vs mean 88.24, SD 4.56;P=.02) than the control group. There was no significant difference in medical writing between both groups (mean 75.07, SD 3.61, vs mean 75.71, SD 2.86;P=.37). The postcourse feedback questionnaire indicated that VSP-TCM can better enhance students’ TCM thinking ability (n=39, 93%, vs n=37, 88%;P=.002), medical history collection (n=38, 90%, vs n=30, 72;P=.001), syndrome differentiation and treatment and critical thinking (n=38, 90%, vs n=37, 88%;P=.046), comprehensive clinical application ability (n=40, 95%, vs n=36, 86%;P=.009), interpersonal communication skills (n=36, 86%, vs n=28, 67%;P=.01), and autonomous learning ability (n=37, 88%, vs n=28, 67%;P=.01) than traditional academic training. Similarly, the teachers held a positive perspective on VSP-TCM. VSP-TCM enhances students’ TCM clinical competence and dialectical thinking and improves their ability to work autonomously. Moreover, the VSP-TCM system is feasible, practical, and cost-effective and thus merits further promotion in TCM education.
