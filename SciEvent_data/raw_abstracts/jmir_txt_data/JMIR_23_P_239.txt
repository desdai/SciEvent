Digital mental health services are becoming increasingly valuable for addressing the global public health burden of mental ill-health. There is significant demand for scalable and effective web-based mental health services. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve mental health through the deployment of chatbots. These chatbots can provide round-the-clock support and triage individuals who are reluctant to access traditional health care due to stigma. The aim of this viewpoint paper is to consider the feasibility of AI-powered platforms to support mental well-being. The Leora model is considered a model with the potential to provide mental health support. Leora is a conversational agent that uses AI to engage in conversations with users about their mental health and provide support for minimal-to-mild symptoms of anxiety and depression. The tool is designed to be accessible, personalized, and discreet, offering strategies for promoting well-being and acting as a web-based self-care coach. Across all AI-powered mental health services, there are several challenges in the ethical development and deployment of AI in mental health treatment, including trust and transparency, bias and health inequity, and the potential for negative consequences. To ensure the effective and ethical use of AI in mental health care, researchers must carefully consider these challenges and engage with key stakeholders to provide high-quality mental health support. Validation of the Leora platform through rigorous user testing will be the next step in ensuring the model is effective.
