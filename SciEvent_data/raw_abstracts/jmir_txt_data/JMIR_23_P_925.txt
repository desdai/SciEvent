Prior research on the digital divide has documented substantial racial inequality in using web-based health resources. The recent COVID-19 pandemic led to accelerated mass digitization, raising alarms that underprivileged racial minority groups are left further behind. However, it is unclear to what extent the use of health information and communications technology by underprivileged racial minority groups is affected. We have considered the COVID-19 disruption as a rare exogenous shock and estimated the impact of the accelerated digitization on the quantity and variety of patient portal use. In this study, we aimed to answer the following 2 key research questions. Did patients alter their use of health information and communications technology owing to COVID-19–induced digital acceleration? Does the effect differ across racial lines? We used a longitudinal patient portal use data set gathered from a large urban academic medical center to explore the effect of accelerated digitization on the racial digital gap in health care. We limited the sample period of our study to 2 same periods (March 11 to August 30) in 2019 and 2020. Our final sample consisted of 25,612 patients belonging to 1 of the 3 racial groups: Black or African American (n=5157, 20.13%), Hispanic (n=253, 0.99%), and White (n=20,202, 78.88%) patients. We estimated the panel data regression using 3 different models: pooled ordinary least squares (OLS), random effect (RE), and fixed effect (FE). Our study yielded 4 findings. First, we confirmed that the racial digital divide remains a significant issue for telehealth; underprivileged racial minority group patients had lower patient portal use than White patients before the pandemic (Minority: OLS, β=−.158;P<.001; RE, β=−.168;P<.001). Second, we found that the digital gap regarding patient portal use frequency between underprivileged racial minority groups and White patients isshrinkingrather than widening after the COVID-19 pandemic started (COVID_Period×Minority: OLS, β=.028;P=.002; RE, β=.037;P<.001; FE, β=.043;P<.001). Third, the shrinking gap is foremost driven by access through mobile (vs desktop) devices (COVID_Period×Minority: web, β=−.020;P=.02; mobile, β=.037;P<.001). Finally, underprivileged racial minority groups expanded their use of a variety of portal functionalities faster than White patients during the pandemic (COVID_Period×Minority[for functionality]: OLS, β=−.004;P<.001; RE, β=−.004;P<.001; FE, β=−.003;P=.001). Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a natural experiment, we offer empirical evidence that accelerated digitization has shrunk the racial digital divide in telehealth, and the trend is mostly driven by mobile devices. These findings provide new insights into the digital behaviors among underprivileged racial minority groups during accelerated digitization. They also offer policy makers an opportunity to identify new strategies to help close the racial digital gap in the postpandemic world.
