Physical inactivity is a known risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF). Wearable devices, such as smartwatches, present an opportunity to investigate the relation between daily step count and AF risk. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between daily step count and the predicted 5-year risk of AF. Participants from the electronic Framingham Heart Study used an Apple smartwatch. Individuals with diagnosed AF were excluded. Daily step count, watch wear time (hours and days), and self-reported physical activity data were collected. Individuals’ 5-year risk of AF was estimated, using the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE)–AF score. The relation between daily step count and predicted 5-year AF risk was examined via linear regression, adjusting for age, sex, and wear time. Secondary analyses examined effect modification by sex and obesity (BMI≥30 kg/m2), as well as the relation between self-reported physical activity and predicted 5-year AF risk. We examined 923 electronic Framingham Heart Study participants (age: mean 53, SD 9 years; female: n=563, 61%) who had a median daily step count of 7227 (IQR 5699-8970). Most participants (n=823, 89.2%) had a <2.5% CHARGE-AF risk. Every 1000 steps were associated with a 0.08% lower CHARGE-AF risk (P<.001). A stronger association was observed in men and individuals with obesity. In contrast, self-reported physical activity was not associated with CHARGE-AF risk. Higher daily step counts were associated with a lower predicted 5-year risk of AF, and this relation was stronger in men and participants with obesity. The utility of a wearable daily step counter for AF risk reduction merits further investigation.
