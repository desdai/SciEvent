Health care is undergoing a profound transformation through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI). However, the rapid integration and expansive growth of AI within health care systems present ethical and legal challenges that warrant careful consideration. In this viewpoint, the author argues that the health care domain, due to its complexity, requires specialized approaches to regulating AI. Precise regulation can provide clear guidelines for addressing these challenges, thereby ensuring ethical and legal AI implementations.
