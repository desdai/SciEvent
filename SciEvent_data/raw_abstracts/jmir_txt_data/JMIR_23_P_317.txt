Chronic disease incidence among the elderly is increasing, which is correlated with the acceleration of population aging. Evolving internet technologies may help prevent and provide interventions for chronic diseases in an accelerating aging process. However, the impact of daily internet use on the incidence of chronic diseases is not well understood. This study aims to investigate whether daily internet use by middle-aged and older adults may inhibit or promote the occurrence of chronic diseases. We included participants from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), a longitudinal survey of Chinese residents aged â‰¥45 years. We assessed 8-year data from wave 1 (June 2011-March 2012) to wave 4 (July-September 2018) in CHARLS. Data from wave 4 were used for a cross-sectional study, and data from all 4 waves were used for a longitudinal study. Self-reported data were used to track variables, including internet use, use frequency, and the incidence of different chronic diseases. Cox proportional hazards modeling was applied in the longitudinal study to examine the relationship between daily internet use and chronic diseases among middle-aged and older adults, while adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and health behaviors. In addition, longitudinal data were used to analyze internet usage trends, and cross-sectional data were used to analyze the factors influencing internet use. Among the 20,113 participants included in the longitudinal analyses, internet use increased significantly, from 2% to 12.3%, between 2011 and 2018. The adjusted model found statistically significant relationships between daily internet use and a lower incidence of the following chronic diseases: hypertension (hazard ratio [HR] 0.78, 95% CI 0.65-0.95,P=.01), chronic lung disease (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57-0.97,P=.03), stroke (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50-0.94,P=.02), digestive disease (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58-0.91,P=.005), memory-related disorders (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37-0.91,P=.02), arthritis or rheumatism (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.48-0.76,P<.001), asthma (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.33-0.84,P=.007), depression (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71-0.89,P<.001), and vision impairment (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74-0.93,P=.004). Moreover, our study also showed that with increasing frequency of internet use, the risk of some chronic diseases decreases. This study found that middle-aged and older adults who use the internet have a reduced risk of developing chronic diseases versus those who do not use the internet. The increasing prevalence of daily internet use among middle-aged and older adults may stimulate contemplation of the potential role of internet platforms in future research on chronic disease prevention.
