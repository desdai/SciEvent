The Networking, Open Discussion, Engagement, and Self-Promotion (NODES) framework is a strategy that women in medicine can deploy at conferences to broaden their professional networks and engage with colleagues. The NODES framework was designed and implemented for use at the Women in Medicine Summit, an annual conference that unites women to combat gender inequality in medicine. Intentional use of social media at conferences using the NODES framework by women in medicine can increase the visibility of research projects and may lead to speaking engagements and awards.
