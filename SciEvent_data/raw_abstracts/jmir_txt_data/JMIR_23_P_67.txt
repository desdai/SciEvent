Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain syndrome characterized by persistent and widespread musculoskeletal pain. Telerehabilitation is a promising treatment for patients with fibromyalgia through long-term monitoring, intervention, supervision, consultation, and education. This study aimed to perform a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of telerehabilitation in patients with fibromyalgia. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) related to fibromyalgia and telerehabilitation were systematically searched in the PubMed, PEDro, Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science databases from inception to November 13, 2022. Two independent researchers screened the literatures and evaluated the methodological quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. The outcome measures included the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire scale, pain intensity, depression, pain catastrophizing, quality of life (QoL), and adverse events. Pooled effect sizes were calculated by Stata SE 15.1; a fixed effects model was used whenI2<50%, whereas a random effects model was used whenI2≥50%. A total of 14 RCTs with 1242 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled results indicated that the telerehabilitation improved the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire score (weighted mean difference –8.32, 95% CI –11.72 to –4.91;P<.001), pain intensity (standardized mean difference [SMD] –0.62, 95% CI –0.76 to –0.47;P<.001), depression levels (SMD –0.42, 95% CI –0.62 to –0.22;P<.001), pain catastrophizing (weighted mean difference –5.81, 95% CI –9.40 to –2.23;P=.001), and QoL (SMD 0.32, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.47;P<.001) in patients with fibromyalgia compared to control interventions. Only 1 RCT reported a mild adverse event of telerehabilitation; the other 13 RCTs did not mention this. Telerehabilitation can improve the symptoms and QoL of fibromyalgia. However, the safety of telerehabilitation remains uncertain due to the lack of sufficient evidence for the management of fibromyalgia. More rigorously designed trials are needed in the future to verify the safety and efficacy of telerehabilitation in fibromyalgia. PROSPERO CRD42022338200; https://tinyurl.com/322keukv
