In November 2022, OpenAI publicly launched its large language model (LLM), ChatGPT, and reached the milestone of having over 100 million users in only 2 months. LLMs have been shown to be useful in a myriad of health care–related tasks and processes. In this paper, I argue that attention to, public access to, and debate about LLMs have initiated a wave of products and services using generative artificial intelligence (AI), which had previously found it hard to attract physicians. This paper describes what AI tools have become available since the beginning of the ChatGPT revolution and contemplates how it they might change physicians’ perceptions about this breakthrough technology.
