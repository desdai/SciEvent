Life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (LTVAs) are main causes of sudden cardiac arrest and are highly associated with an increased risk of mortality. A prediction model that enables early identification of the high-risk individuals is still lacking. We aimed to build machine learning (ML)â€“based models to predict in-hospital mortality in patients with LTVA. A total of 3140 patients with LTVA were randomly divided into training (n=2512, 80%) and internal validation (n=628, 20%) sets. Moreover, data of 2851 patients from another database were collected as the external validation set. The primary output was the probability of in-hospital mortality. The discriminatory ability was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The prediction performances of 5 ML algorithms were compared with 2 conventional scoring systems, namely, the simplified acute physiology score (SAPS-II) and the logistic organ dysfunction system (LODS). The prediction performance of the 5 ML algorithms significantly outperformed the traditional models in predicting in-hospital mortality. CatBoost showed the highest AUC of 90.5% (95% CI 87.5%-93.5%), followed by LightGBM with an AUC of 90.1% (95% CI 86.8%-93.4%). Conversely, the predictive values of SAPS-II and LODS were unsatisfactory, with AUCs of 78.0% (95% CI 71.7%-84.3%) and 74.9% (95% CI 67.2%-82.6%), respectively. The superiority of ML-based models was also shown in the external validation set. ML-based models could improve the predictive values of in-hospital mortality prediction for patients with LTVA compared with traditional scoring systems.
