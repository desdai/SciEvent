The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased patient volumes, staff shortages, and limited resources in emergency departments, resulting in the rapid acceleration of telemedicine in emergency medicine. The virtual first (VF) program connects patients with emergency medicine clinicians via synchronous virtual video visits, reducing unnecessary emergency department visits and diverting patients to appropriate care settings. VF video visits can improve patient outcomes by providing early intervention for acute care needs and can enhance patient satisfaction by providing convenient, accessible, and personalized care. However, challenges include the lack of physical examination, clinician telehealth training and competencies, and the requirement for a robust telemedicine infrastructure. Additionally, digital health equity is important to ensure equitable access to care. Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of VF video visits in emergency medicine are substantial, and this study is a strong step in building the evidence base for these advancements.
