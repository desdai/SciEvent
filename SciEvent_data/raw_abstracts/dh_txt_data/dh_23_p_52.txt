Proverbs are an essential component of language and culture, and though much attention has been paid to their history and currency, there has been comparatively little quantitative work on changes in the frequency with which they are used over time. With wider availability of large corpora reflecting many diverse genres of documents, it is now possible to take a broad and dynamic view of the importance of the proverb. Here, we measure temporal changes in the relevance of proverbs within four corpora, differing in kind, scale, and time frame: Millions of books over centuries; thousands of books over centuries; millions of news articles over twenty years; and billions of tweets over a decade. While similar methodologies abound lately, they have not yet been performed using comprehensive phraseological lexica (here,The Dictionary of American Proverbs). We show that beyond simple partitioning of texts into words, searches for culturally significant phrases can yield distinct insights from the same corpora. Comparative analysis between four commonly used corpora show that each reveals its own relationship to the phenomena being studied. We also find that the frequency with which proverbs appear in texts follows a similar distribution to that of individual words.
