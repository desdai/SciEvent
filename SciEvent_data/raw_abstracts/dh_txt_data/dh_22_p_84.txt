The annual, international Digital Humanities conference is what originally brought ADHO (the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations) together. Many see it as a cornerstone of our collective identity which enables collaboration, networking, and the international dissemination of scholarship in the field. This response to “The circus we deserve? A front row look at the organization of the annual academic conference for the Digital Humanities” by Laura Estill, Jennifer Guiliano, Élika Ortega, Melissa Terras, Deb Verhoeven and Glen Layne-Worthey engages with its call for ADHO to improve its processes and practices surrounding the DH conference by describing the work that has been done to date, and initiatives ADHO is now undertaking.
