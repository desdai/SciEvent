Reprocessing printed source material and facilitating large-scale qualitative as well as quantitative analyses with digital methods poses many challenges. A case study on approximately 10,000 inventory entries for legal cases from the Special Court Munich (1933â€“1945) highlights those and offers a glimpse into a digitisation workflow that allows for in-depth computer-aided analysis. For this paper, different methods and procedures for developing categorisation systems for legal charges are discussed.
