Since there has been a recent trend to establishing virtual museums, which various institutions have swiftly responded to, the objective of this paper is to understand the nature of virtual and/or digital museums by focusing on their particular characteristics. In this approach, the paper proceeds from the assumption that museum representations in the virtual space and/or virtual museums could extend conventional or physical museum space, leading to enhanced visitor attraction and experience. The paper thus focuses on the virtual museum as an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary object of investigation from the perspective of museology and digital humanities and seeks to ascertain whether scholarly and practical impacts are achieved. It also analyses the expected impacts on practical museum work and visitor needs, especially with respect to the tasks museums are required to fulfil in times of crisis.
