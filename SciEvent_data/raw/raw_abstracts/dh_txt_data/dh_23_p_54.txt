The paper focuses on a prototype interactive web-map developed for the presentation and dissemination of architectural transformations at the monastic site of San Julián de Samos in north-western Spain. The paper’s central argument offers a response to questions regarding why and how to create an interactive web-map in the field of architectural history through a particular case study. The paper is organized into three main parts. It first presents the project focus on spatiotemporal analysis of a centuries-old Spanish monastic site. Second part is devoted to the specific domain of web-mapping tools and why they can help us to better make sense of complex built environments that humans have formed and re-formed over time. After that, we explain how we faced the process of creating an integral scientific web-map that goes beyond static 2D representations of a multi-layered past physical realm in a definitive publication, the challenges we faced, and the proposed future developments. The prototype web-map of Digital Samos integrates the graphic features of spatial objects with source data in a web publication platform where the reader is granted accessed to fully uncover, interact with, and learn about a historically rich monastic palimpsest.
