In this article I propose that motion capture (mocap) and virtual reality (VR) technology can be used to record and visualize movement histories as a supplement to oral histories or for when a memory is based in a embodied experience. One specific example would be the presentation of illness narratives. To illustrate this situation, I examine the concept of illness narratives, particularly those created by dance artists, and use my movement history,Lithium Hindsight 360, as a case study. This analysis comes from the perspective of a hybrid movement artist, VR creator, archivist and digital humanist, with first-hand experience of the challenges encountered when creating a movement history. The challenges are presented within the context of mocap recording, data curation, digital preservation and sustainability issues. I end this article by providing some basic practical strategies and recommendations for researchers who are new to documenting movement histories.
