In this article, I discuss my project “Ancestral Code”, which consists of anintegrated development environment(IDE) and the Nehiyaw (Plains Cree) based programming languages calledCree#(pronounced: Cree-Sharp) andᐊᒋᒧ(âcimow). These languages developed in response to western perspectives on human-computer relationships, which I challenge and reframe in Nehiyaw/Indigenous contexts.
