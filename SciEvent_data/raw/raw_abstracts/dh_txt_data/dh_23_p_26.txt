As a case study for the practice and application of digital history in a mid-size university history department, this paper analyzes two History Harvest events undertaken in a split-level digital history course. By examining the results of two local History Harvests, specifically through participation of the greater community, outside the university, and the preservation and digitization of the local historical items, we discuss the impact history harvests can have on a community, as well as history students. The primary goal of both History Harvests outlined in this paper was to work with the local community surrounding the university to preserve pieces of local history. This article provides guidelines for conducting a History Harvest including suggestions for community outreach, local university involvement with the greater community, and digitizing issues that might occur while conducting the Harvest.
