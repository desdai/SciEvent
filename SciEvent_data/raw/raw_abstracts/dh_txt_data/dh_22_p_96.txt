This short reflective essay meditates on how/why digital Blackness need not strive to recover or repair humanity for Black peoples. It questions the teleological drive for building Black digital archives and technologies motivated by representational politics. The foray performatively suggests otherwise by leaning into Sylvia Wynter’s (2007) notion that such folding into the figure of the human — overrepresented by Western Man — snuffs polyvalent and polysemic pluralities for Blackness.
