This study presents the results of the research project on the Ballets Espagnols de Antonia Merc√© La Argentina, a dance company active between 1927 and 1929 that adapted the model of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes to a repertoire based on the construction of a national identity through the modern and avant-garde aesthetics of interwar Europe. The systematisation of the preserved sources and their visualisation in interactive maps permits research to be carried out on one of the most brilliant episodes in the history of Spanish dance and to collaborate in the recovery of a forgotten dance heritage.
