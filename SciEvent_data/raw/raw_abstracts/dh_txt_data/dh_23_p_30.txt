This paper presents methodology and findings from a multi-case study exploring the use of preservation and sustainability measures to increase access to digital humanities (DH) content. Specifically, we seek to develop a workflow to both prepare DH content for preservation while enhancing the accessibility of the project. This work is based on the idea of treating DH as traditional data by applying data curation and digital preservation methods to DH content. Our outcomes are an evaluation of the process and output using qualitative methods, publicly accessible and described project components on two Virginia Tech projects, and a potential workflow that can be applied to future work. By breaking down individual projects into their respective components of content, code, metadata, and documentation and examining each component individually for access and preservation, we can begin migrating our digital scholarship to a sustainable, portable, and accessible existence.
