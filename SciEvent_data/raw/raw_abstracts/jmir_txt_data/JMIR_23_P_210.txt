Brauneck and colleagues have combined technical and legal perspectives in their timely and valuable paper “Federated Machine Learning, Privacy-Enhancing Technologies, and Data Protection Laws in Medical Research: Scoping Review.” Researchers who design mobile health (mHealth) systems must adopt the same privacy-by-design approach that privacy regulations (eg, General Data Protection Regulation) do. In order to do this successfully, we will have to overcome implementation challenges in privacy-enhancing technologies such as differential privacy. We will also have to pay close attention to emerging technologies such as private synthetic data generation.
