Mobile health platforms like smartphone apps that provide clinical guidelines are ubiquitous, yet their long-term impact on guideline adherence remains unclear. In 2016, an antibiotic guidelines app, called SCRIPT, was introduced in Auckland City Hospital, New Zealand, to provide local antibiotic guidelines to clinicians on their smartphones. We aimed to assess whether the provision of antibiotic guidelines in a smartphone app resulted in sustained changes in antibiotic guideline adherence by prescribers. We analyzed antibiotic guideline adherence rates during the first 24 hours of hospital admission in adults diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia using an interrupted time-series study with 3 distinct periods post app implementation (ie, 3, 12, and 24 months). Adherence increased from 23% (46/200) at baseline to 31% (73/237) at 3 months and 34% (69/200) at 12 months, reducing to 31% (62/200) at 24 months post app implementation (P=.07 vs baseline). However, increased adherence was sustained in patients with pulmonary consolidation on x-ray (9/63, 14% at baseline; 23/77, 30% after 3 months; 32/92, 35% after 12 month; and 32/102, 31% after 24 months;P=.04 vs baseline). An antibiotic guidelines app increased overall adherence, but this was not sustained. In patients with pulmonary consolidation, the increased adherence was sustained.
