The peripartum period, defined as the period from the beginning of the gestation until 1 year after the delivery, has long been shown to be potentially associated with increased levels of stress and anxiety with regard to oneâ€™s transition to the status of parent and the accompanying parental tasks. Yet, no research to date has investigated changes in intrapersonal factors during the peripartum period in women at risk for pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH). The aim of this study is to explore and describe changes in intrapersonal factors in participants at risk for PIH. We used an explorative design in which 3 questionnaires were sent by email to 110 participants the day following enrollment in the Pregnancy Remote Monitoring program for pregnant women at risk for PIH. Women were invited to complete the questionnaires at the beginning of their participation in the Pregnancy Remote Monitoring project (mostly at 14 weeks of gestation) and after approaching 32 weeks of gestational age (GA). The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 were used to assess anxiety and depression, and adaptation of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale was used to measure trait pain catastrophizing. Scores were significantly higher at 32 weeks of GA than at the moment of enrollment (GAD-7 score=7, range 4-11 vs 5, range 3-8;P=.01; and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score=6, range 4-10 vs 4, range 2-7;P<.001). The subscale scores of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale were all lower at 32 weeks of GA compared with 14 weeks of GA (rumination: 4, range 1-6 vs 5, range 2-9.5;P=.11; magnification: 3, range 1-5.5 vs 4, range 3-7;P=.04; and helplessness: 5, range 2-9 vs 6, range 3.5-12;P=.06). The proportion of women with a risk for depression (GAD-7 score >10) was 13.3% (10/75) at enrollment and had increased to 35.6% (26/75) at 32 weeks of GA. This study shows that pregnant women at risk for PIH have higher levels of stress and anxiety at 32 weeks of GA than at the moment of enrollment. Further research is recommended to investigate potential strategies to help pregnant women at risk for PIH manage feelings of stress and anxiety.
