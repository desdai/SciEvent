Patients followed for a pregnancy of unknown location are generally followed by a team of clinicians through telephone calls, and their contraceptive needs at the time of pregnancy resolution may not be addressed. This study aimed to assess contraceptive counseling and contraceptive uptake before and after a telephone-based intervention. This was a retrospective pre-post study assessing pregnancy intendedness in patients with a pregnancy of unknown location and the proportion of patients who received contraceptive counseling and a contraceptive prescription before and after the initiation of a telephone-based intervention. We reviewed medical records 1 year before and 1 year after implementation of our intervention for demographic characteristics, pregnancy intendedness, pregnancy outcome, contraceptive counseling documentation, receipt of contraception, and repeat pregnancy within 6 months. We assessed the effects of an implementation strategy to address family planning needs once pregnancy was resolved by comparing the proportions of patients who were counseled and received contraception before and after our intervention was implemented. We performed logistic regression to identify associations between covariates and the outcomes of contraceptive counseling documentation and receipt of contraception. Of the 220 patients in the combined cohort, the majority were Black (161/220, 73%) and ultimately had a resolved pregnancy of unknown location (162/220, 74%), and the proportion of pregnancies documented as unintended was 60% (132/220). Before our intervention, 27 of 100 (27%) patients received contraceptive counseling, compared with 94 of 120 (78%) patients after the intervention (odds ratio [OR] 9.77, 95% CI 5.26-18.16). Before the intervention, 17 of 90 (19%) patients who did not desire repeat pregnancy received contraception, compared with 32 of 86 (37%) patients after the intervention (OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.28-5.05). Our postintervention cohort had an increased odds of receiving contraceptive counseling (OR 9.77, 95% CI 5.26-18.16) and of receiving a contraceptive prescription (OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.28-5.05) compared with our preintervention cohort. We found that over half of patients with a pregnancy of unknown location have an unintended pregnancy, and standardization of care through a telephone-based intervention improves contraceptive counseling and prescribing in patients with a resolved pregnancy of unknown location. This intervention could be used at any institution that follows patients with a pregnancy of unknown location remotely to improve care.
