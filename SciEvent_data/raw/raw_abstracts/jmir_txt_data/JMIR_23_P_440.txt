Although it is well known that adolescents frequently turn to their friends for support around mental health and substance use problems, there are currently no evidence-based digital programs to support them to do this. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of theMind your Mateprogram, a digital peer-support program, in improving mental health symptoms, reducing the uptake of substance use, and increasing help seeking. TheMind your Mateprogram consists of a 40-minute web-based classroom lesson and a companion smartphone mobile app. The active control group received school-based health education as usual. A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted with 12 secondary schools and 166 students (mean age 15.3, SD 0.41 years; 72/166, 43.4% female; and 133/166, 80.1% born in Australia). Participants completed self-reported questionnaires assessing symptoms of mental health (depression, anxiety, and psychological distress), substance use (alcohol and other drug use), and help-seeking measures at baseline and at 6-month and 12-month follow-ups. Students who received theMind your Mateprogram had greater reductions in depressive symptoms over a 12-month period than controls (b=−1.86, 95% CI −3.73 to 0.02; Cohend=−0.31). Anxiety symptoms decreased among students in the intervention group; however, these reductions did not meet statistical significance thresholds. No differences were observed in relation to psychological distress or help-seeking. Small to moderate reductions in depression symptoms were observed among students allocated to receive theMind your Mateintervention. Although the current results are encouraging, there is a need to continue to refine, develop, and evaluate innovative applied approaches for the prevention of mental disorders in real-world settings.
