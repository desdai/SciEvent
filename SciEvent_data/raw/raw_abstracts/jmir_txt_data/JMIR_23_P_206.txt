Acquired brain injury (ABI) in children and adolescents can lead to motor and executive impairments that often require long-term treatment. The implementation of web-based telerehabilitation therapy at home is a method to improve the functional status of patients. Therefore, we performed a systematic review of the effects of web-based telerehabilitation programs on functional outcomes in children and adolescents with brain injury and supplemented the findings with a meta-analysis. This study evaluated the therapeutic effect of web-based telerehabilitation training on children and adolescents with brain injury to determine whether web-based telerehabilitation therapy improved motor function, executive function, physical activity level, lower limb strength, hand and upper limb function, visual processing skills, and occupational functional performance in children and adolescents with brain injury. PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials on web-based telerehabilitation programs in children and adolescents with brain injury until December 2022, and the risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration Tool. Relevant data were extracted, and a meta-analysis was performed using RevMan5.3 software. Overall, 17 studies involving 848 patients were included. Web-based telerehabilitation therapy improved the motor function (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.29, 95% CI 0.01-0.57;P=.04), physical activity level (SMD 0.42, 95% CI 0.11-0.73;P=.007), lower limb strength (SMD 0.52, 95% CI 0.13-0.90;P=.009), and visual processing skills (SMD 0.26, 95% CI 0.02-0.50;P=.04) of children and adolescents with brain injury. It also improved executive function in letter-number sequencing (SMD 1.26, 95% CI 0.26-2.26;P=.01), attention (SMD 0.38, 95% CI 0.09-0.66;P=.009), and symbol search (SMD 1.18, 95% CI 0.43-1.93,P=.002). Web-based telerehabilitation therapy improved motor function, physical activity level, lower limb strength, letter-number sequencing, attention, and symbol search, which improved the quality of life in children and adolescents with brain injury. Web-based telerehabilitation programs provide great convenience for children and adolescents with ABI who need long-term treatment and allow them to exercise at home for rehabilitation training. The widespread implementation of remote interventions also provides children and adolescents in remote areas with better access to rehabilitation services. This review provides evidence for the effectiveness of web-based telerehabilitation therapy, but there was heterogeneity in some of the results because of different disease types and intervention programs. Future studies can expand the sample size according to disease type and increase follow-up time according to different exercise prescriptions to further refine the long-term effects of this intervention on various functions of children and adolescents with ABI.
