Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a disease that commonly affects premature infants whose lungs are not fully developed. RDS results from a lack of surfactant in the lungs. The more premature the infant is, the greater is the likelihood of having RDS. However, even though not all premature infants have RDS, preemptive treatment with artificial pulmonary surfactant is administered in most cases. We aimed to develop an artificial intelligence model to predict RDS in premature infants to avoid unnecessary treatment. In this study, 13,087 very low birth weight infants who were newborns weighing less than 1500 grams were assessed in 76 hospitals of the Korean Neonatal Network. To predict RDS in very low birth weight infants, we used basic infant information, maternity history, pregnancy/birth process, family history, resuscitation procedure, and test results at birth such as blood gas analysis and Apgar score. The prediction performances of 7 different machine learning models were compared, and a 5-layer deep neural network was proposed in order to enhance the prediction performance from the selected features. An ensemble approach combining multiple models from the 5-fold cross-validation was subsequently developed. Our proposed ensemble 5-layer deep neural network consisting of the top 20 features provided high sensitivity (83.03%), specificity (87.50%), accuracy (84.07%), balanced accuracy (85.26%), and area under the curve (0.9187). Based on the model that we developed, a public web application that enables easy access for the prediction of RDS in premature infants was deployed. Our artificial intelligence model may be useful for preparations for neonatal resuscitation, particularly in cases involving the delivery of very low birth weight infants, as it can aid in predicting the likelihood of RDS and inform decisions regarding the administration of surfactant.
