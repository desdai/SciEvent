Digital phenotyping refers to nearâ€“real-time data collection from personal digital devices, particularly smartphones, to better quantify the human phenotype. Methodology using smartphones is often considered the gold standard by many for passive data collection within the field of digital phenotyping, which limits its applications mainly to adults or adolescents who use smartphones. However, other technologies, such as wearable devices, have evolved considerably in recent years to provide similar or better quality passive physiologic data of clinical relevance, thus expanding the potential of digital phenotyping applications to other patient populations. In this perspective, we argue for the continued expansion of digital phenotyping to include other potential gold standards in addition to smartphones and provide examples of currently excluded technologies and populations who may uniquely benefit from this technology.
