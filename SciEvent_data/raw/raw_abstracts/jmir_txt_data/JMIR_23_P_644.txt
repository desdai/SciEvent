As highlighted by the recent World Health Organization Oral Health Resolution, there is an urgent need to better integrate primary and oral health care. Despite evidence and guidelines substantiating the relevance of integrating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and periodontitis care, the fragmentation of primary and oral health care persists. This paper reports on the evaluation of a prototype digital decision support system (DSS) that was developed to enhance the integration of T2DM and periodontitis care. The effects of the prototype DSS were assessed in web-based simulated environments, using 2 different sets of case vignettes in combination with evaluation surveys among 202 general dental practitioners (GDPs) and 206 general practitioners (GPs). Each participant evaluated 3 vignettes, one of which, chosen at random, was assisted by the DSS. Logistic regression analyses were conducted at the participant and case levels. Under DSS assistance, GPs had 8.3 (95% CI 4.32-16.03) times higher odds of recommending a GDP visit. There was no significant impact of DSS assistance on GP advice about common risk factors for T2DM and periodontal disease. GDPs had 4.3 (95% CI 2.08-9.04) times higher odds of recommending a GP visit, 1.6 (95% CI 1.03-2.33) times higher odds of giving advice on disease correlations, and 3.2 (95% CI 1.63-6.35) times higher odds of asking patients about their glycated hemoglobin value. The findings of this study provide a proof of concept for a digital DSS to integrate T2DM and periodontal care. Future updating and testing is warranted to continuously enhance the functionalities of the DSS in terms of interoperability with various types of data sources and diagnostic devices; incorporation of other (oral) health dimensions; application in various settings, including via telemedicine; and further customization of end-user interfaces.
