The National Health Service (NHS), the health care system of the United Kingdom, is one of the largest health care entities in the world and has been successfully serving the UK population for decades. The NHS is also the fourth-largest employer globally. True to its reputation, some of the most modern and technically advanced medical services are available in the United Kingdom. However, between the acute, primary, secondary, and tertiary care providers of the NHS, there needs to be seamless integration and interoperability to provide timely holistic care to patients at a national level. Various efforts have been taken and programs launched since 2002 to achieve digital transformation in the NHS but with partial success rates. As it is important to understand a problem before trying to solve it, in this paper, we focus on tools used to assess the digital maturity of NHS trusts and organizations. Additionally, we aim to present the impact of ongoing transformation attempts on secondary services, particularly mental health. This paper considered the literature on digital maturity and performed a rapid review of currently available tools to measure digital maturity. We have performed a multivocal literature review that included white papers and web-based documents in addition to peer-reviewed literature. Further, the paper also provides a perspective of the ground reality from a mental health service providerâ€™s point of view. Assessment tools adopted from the global market, later modified and tailor-made to suit local preferences, are currently being used. However, there is a need for a robust framework that assesses status, allows target setting, and tracks progress across diverse providers.
