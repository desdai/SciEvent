Machine learning is a potentially effective method for identifying and predicting the time of the onset of stroke. However, the value of applying machine learning in this field remains controversial and debatable. We aimed to assess the value of applying machine learning in predicting the time of stroke onset. PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane were comprehensively searched. The C index and sensitivity with 95% CI were used as effect sizes. The risk of bias was evaluated using PROBAST (Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool), and meta-analysis was conducted using R (version 4.2.0; R Core Team). Thirteen eligible studies were included in the meta-analysis involving 55 machine learning models with 41 models in the training set and 14 in the validation set. The overall C index was 0.800 (95% CI 0.773-0.826) in the training set and 0.781 (95% CI 0.709-0.852) in the validation set. The sensitivity and specificity were 0.76 (95% CI 0.73-0.80) and 0.79 (95% CI 0.74-0.82) in the training set and 0.81 (95% CI 0.68-0.90) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.73-0.89) in the validation set, respectively. Subgroup analysis revealed that the accuracy of machine learning in predicting the time of stroke onset within 4.5 hours was optimal (training: 0.80, 95% CI 0.77-0.83; validation: 0.79, 95% CI 0.71-0.86). Machine learning has ideal performance in identifying the time of stroke onset. More reasonable image segmentation and texture extraction methods in radiomics should be used to promote the value of applying machine learning in diverse ethnic backgrounds.
