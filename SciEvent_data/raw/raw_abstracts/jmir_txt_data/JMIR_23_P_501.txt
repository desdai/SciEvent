Programs aimed at modernizing thyroid care by pairing at-home sample collection methods with telehealth options may serve an important and emerging role in thyroid care. The primary objective of this analysis was to evaluate telehealth use, demographics, and clinical characteristics of a cohort of consumer-initiated at-home laboratory thyroid test users who were also offered the option of follow-up telehealth consultations. This was a retrospective analysis of real-world data from a deidentified consumer database of home-collected, mail-in thyroid tests used from March to May 2021 (N=8152). The mean age was 38.6 (range 18-85) years, and 86.6% (n=7061) of individuals identified as female. In total, 7% (n=587) of test takers fell into a thyroid dysfunction category (overt hypothyroidism: n=75, 0.9%; subclinical hypothyroidism: n=236, 2.9%; overt hyperthyroidism: n=5, 0.1%; and subclinical hyperthyroidism: n=271, 3.3%). Overall, 12% (n=984) of the overall sample opted into a telehealth consultation, with 91.8% (n=903) receiving a nontreatment telehealth consultation and 8.2% (n=81) receiving a treatment telemedicine consultation. Furthermore, 16% (n=96) of individuals with overt or subclinical thyroid dysfunction engaged in telehealth consultations. The majority of treatment consultations (59.3%, n=48) were conducted with people reporting a history of thyroid issues, with 55.6% (n=45) of people indicating wanting to discuss their current thyroid medication and 48% (n=39) receiving a prescription medication. The combination of at-home sample collection and telehealth is an innovative model for screening thyroid disorders, monitoring thyroid function, and increasing access to care, which can be implemented at a large scale and across a wide range of age groups.
