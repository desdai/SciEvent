Mobile health (mHealth) technology has the potential to support shared decision-making (SDM) and improve hypertension control. However, our understanding of the variations in individuals’ involvement in SDM and mHealth usage across different racial and ethnic groups in the United States is still limited. This study aimed to investigate the extent of involvement in SDM and the usage of mHealth technology in health-related activities among US adults with hypertension from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds and to examine whether the mHealth usage differed by individuals’ level of engagement in SDM. This study used cross-sectional data from the 2017 to 2020 Health Information National Trends Survey, which was conducted on US adults with self-reported hypertension, and race and ethnicity data were included. The exposure of interest was race and ethnicity. The outcomes were SDM and mHealth usage. SDM was assessed using an item: “In the past 12 months, how often did your health professional: involve you in decisions about your healthcare as much as you wanted?” mHealth usage was defined as using a smartphone or tablet to engage in (1) making health decisions, (2) discussing health decisions with health providers, (3) tracking health progress, and (4) sharing health information. Weighted multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the association between race and ethnicity and SDM or mHealth usage adjusted for covariates and stratified by the level of engagement in SDM. This study included 4893 adults with hypertension, and the mean age was 61 (SD 13) years. The sample was 53% female, 61% (n=3006) non-Hispanic White, 19% (n=907) non-Hispanic Black or African American, 12% (n=605) Hispanic, 4% (n=193) non-Hispanic Asian, and 4% (n=182) non-Hispanic other. Compared to the non-Hispanic White adults, non-Hispanic Black adults were more likely to use mHealth to make health decisions (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.70, 95% CI 1.23-2.34), share health information (aOR 1.46, 95% CI 1.02-2.08), and discuss health decisions with health providers (aOR 1.38, 95% CI 1.02-1.87). Significant associations were observed specifically among those who were always involved in SDM. Asian adults were less likely to be involved in SDM (aOR 0.51, 95% CI 0.26-0.99) and were more likely to use mHealth to track progress on a health-related goal (aOR 2.07, 95% CI 1.28-3.34) than non-Hispanic White adults. Hispanic adults were less likely to use mHealth to share health information (aOR 0.47, 95% CI 0.33-0.67) and discuss health decisions with health providers (aOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46-0.94) compared to non-Hispanic White adults. This study observed racial and ethnic disparities in SDM and mHealth usage among US adults with hypertension. These findings emphasize the significance of comprehending the involvement of SDM and the usage of mHealth technology within racially and ethnically diverse populations.
