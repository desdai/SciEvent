Depression and anxiety are common comorbidities in cardiovascular clinic outpatients. Timely identification and intervention of these mental and psychological disorders can contribute to correct diagnosis, better prognosis, less medical expenses, and improved quality of life. The convenience of online doctor-patient communication platforms has increasingly attracted patients to online consultations. However, online health care and offline health care are very different. Research on how to identify psychological disorders in patients who engage in an online cardiology consultation is lacking. This study aimed to explore the feasibility of using a self-rating scale to assess mental illness among patients who consult with a cardiologist online and to compare the differences in anxiety and depression between online and offline patients. From June 2022 to July 2022, we conducted follow-up visits with 10,173 patients on the Haodf platform. We conducted detailed consultations with 286 patients who visited the same cardiologist in the outpatient department. We used the self-rated Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scales to assess anxiety and depression, respectively. We analyzed the influencing factors related to the degree of coordination of online patients. We also compared the prevalence of anxiety or depression between online and offline patients and analyzed the factors related to anxiety or depression. Of the 10,173 online consultation patients, only 186 (1.8%) responded effectively. The response rate of the offline consultation patients was 96.5% (276/286). Frequent online communication and watching live video broadcasts were significantly related to effective responses from online patients (P<.001). The prevalence of anxiety (70/160, 43.7% vs 69/266, 25.8%;P<.001) or depression (78/160, 48.7% vs 74/266, 27.7%;P<.001) in online consultation patients was significantly higher than that in offline patients. In bivariate analyses, the factors related to anxiety included female sex, unemployment, no confirmed cardiovascular disease, and the online consultation mode, while smokers and those who underwent COVID-19 quarantine were less likely to present with anxiety. The factors related to depression included female sex, divorced or separated individuals, and the online consultation mode. COVID-19 quarantine was related with a lower likelihood of depression. BMI was negatively correlated with depression. In multiple ordered logistic regression analysis, women were more likely than men to present with anxiety (odds ratio [OR] 2.181, 95% CI 1.365-3.486;P=.001). Women (OR 1.664, 95% CI 1.082-2.559;P=.02) and online patients (OR 2.631, 95% CI 1.305-5.304;P=.007) were more likely to have depression. Online patients had more anxiety or depression than offline patients. Anxiety was more prevalent in women, the unemployed, and those without confirmed cardiovascular disease. Women and divorced or separated individuals were more prone to depression. Increasing the frequency of doctor-patient communication and participating in video interactions can help improve patient cooperation.
