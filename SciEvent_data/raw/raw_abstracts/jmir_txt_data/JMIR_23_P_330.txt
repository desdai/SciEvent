Men who have sex with men (MSM) in China hold a low-risk perception of acquiring HIV. This has resulted in an inadequate HIV testing rate. This study aims to investigate whether administering HIV risk self-assessments with tailored feedback on a gay geosocial networking (GSN) app could improve HIV testing rates and reduce sexual risk behaviors in Chinese MSM. We recruited MSM from Beijing, China, who used the GSN platform Blued in October 2017 in this 12-month double-blinded randomized controlled trial. From October 2017 to September 2018, eligible participants were randomly assigned to use a self-reported HIV risk assessment tool that provided tailored feedback according to transmission risk (group 1), access to the same HIV risk assessment without feedback (group 2), or government-recommended HIV education materials (control). All interventions were remotely delivered through the mobile phoneâ€“based app Blued, and participants were followed up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months from baseline. The number of HIV tests over the 12-month study was the primary outcome and was assessed using an intention-to-treat analysis with an incident rate ratio (IRR). Unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) over 6 months was assessed by a modified intention-to-treat analysis and was the secondary outcome. All statistical analyses were conducted in SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc.), and aPvalue <.05 was considered statistically significant. In total, 9280 MSM were recruited from baseline and were randomly assigned to group 1 (n=3028), group 2 (n=3065), or controls (n=3187). After follow-up, 1034 (34.1%), 993 (32.4%), and 1103 (34.6%) remained in each group, respectively. Over 12 months, group 1 took 391 tests (mean of 2.51 tests per person), group 2 took 352 tests (mean of 2.01 tests per person), and controls took 295 tests (mean of 1.72 tests per person). Group 1 had significantly more HIV testing than the control group (IRR 1.32, 95% CI 1.09-4.58;P=.01), while group 2 did not differ significantly from the controls (IRR 1.06, 95% CI 0.86-1.30;P=.60). The proportion of UAI was not statistically different among different groups, but all 3 groups had UAI, which declined from baseline. Repeated HIV risk assessments coupled with tailored feedback through GSN apps improved HIV testing. Such interventions should be considered a simple way of improving HIV testing among MSM in China and increasing awareness of HIV status.
