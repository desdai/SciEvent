Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are widely used in the health care sector. Mainly applied for individualized care, AI is increasingly aimed at population health. This raises important ethical considerations but also calls for responsible governance, considering that this will affect the population. However, the literature points to a lack of citizen participation in the governance of AI in health. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the governance of the ethical and societal implications of AI in population health. This study aimed to explore the perspectives and attitudes of citizens and experts regarding the ethics of AI in population health, the engagement of citizens in AI governance, and the potential of a digital app to foster citizen engagement. We recruited a panel of 21 citizens and experts. Using a web-based survey, we explored their perspectives and attitudes on the ethical issues of AI in population health, the relative role of citizens and other actors in AI governance, and the ways in which citizens can be supported to participate in AI governance through a digital app. The responses of the participants were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. According to the participants, AI is perceived to be already present in population health and its benefits are regarded positively, but there is a consensus that AI has substantial societal implications. The participants also showed a high level of agreement toward involving citizens into AI governance. They highlighted the aspects to be considered in the creation of a digital app to foster this involvement. They recognized the importance of creating an app that is both accessible and transparent. These results offer avenues for the development of a digital app to raise awareness, to survey, and to support citizensâ€™ decision-making regarding the ethical, legal, and social issues of AI in population health.
