Addressing clinician documentation burden through “targeted solutions” is a growing priority for many organizations ranging from government and academia to industry. Between January and February 2021, the 25 by 5: Symposium to Reduce Documentation Burden on US Clinicians by 75% (25X5 Symposium) convened across 2 weekly 2-hour sessions among experts and stakeholders to generate actionable goals for reducing clinician documentation over the next 5 years. Throughout this web-based symposium, we passively collected attendees’ contributions to a chat functionality—with their knowledge that the content would be deidentified and made publicly available. This presented a novel opportunity to synthesize and understand participants’ perceptions and interests from chat messages. We performed a content analysis of 25X5 Symposium chat logs to identify themes about reducing clinician documentation burden. The objective of this study was to explore unstructured chat log content from the web-based 25X5 Symposium to elicit latent insights on clinician documentation burden among clinicians, health care leaders, and other stakeholders using topic modeling. Across the 6 sessions, we captured 1787 messages among 167 unique chat participants cumulatively; 14 were private messages not included in the analysis. We implemented a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model on the aggregated dataset to identify clinician documentation burden topics mentioned in the chat logs. Coherence scores and manual examination informed optimal model selection. Next, 5 domain experts independently and qualitatively assigned descriptive labels to model-identified topics and classified them into higher-level categories, which were finalized through a panel consensus. We uncovered ten topics using the LDA model: (1)determining data and documentation needs(422/1773, 23.8%); (2)collectively reassessing documentation requirements in electronic health records(EHRs) (252/1773, 14.2%); (3)focusing documentation on patient narrative(162/1773, 9.1%); (4)documentation that adds value(147/1773, 8.3%); (5)regulatory impact on clinician burden(142/1773, 8%); (6)improved EHR user interface and design(128/1773, 7.2%); (7)addressing poor usability(122/1773, 6.9%); (8)sharing 25X5 Symposium resources(122/1773, 6.9%); (9)capturing data related to clinician practice(113/1773, 6.4%); and (10)the role of quality measures and technology in burnout(110/1773, 6.2%). Among these 10 topics, 5 high-level categories emerged:consensus building(821/1773, 46.3%),burden sources(365/1773, 20.6%),EHR design(250/1773, 14.1%),patient-centered care(162/1773, 9.1%), andsymposium comments(122/1773, 6.9%). We conducted a topic modeling analysis on 25X5 Symposium multiparticipant chat logs to explore the feasibility of this novel application and elicit additional insights on clinician documentation burden among attendees. Based on the results of our LDA analysis, consensus building, burden sources, EHR design, and patient-centered care may be important themes to consider when addressing clinician documentation burden. Our findings demonstrate the value of topic modeling in discovering topics associated with clinician documentation burden using unstructured textual content. Topic modeling may be a suitable approach to examine latent themes presented in web-based symposium chat logs.
