T cells play an essential role in adaptive immune system to fight pathogens and cancer but may also give rise to autoimmune diseases. The recognition of a peptide-MHC (pMHC) complex by a T cell receptor (TCR) is required to elicit an immune response. Many machine learning models have been developed to predict the binding, but generalizing predictions to pMHCs outside the training data remains challenging. We have developed a new machine learning model that utilizes information about the TCR from both α and β chains, epitope sequence, and MHC. Our method uses ProtBERT embeddings for the amino acid sequences of both chains and the epitope, as well as convolution and multi-head attention architectures. We show the importance of each input feature as well as the benefit of including epitopes with only a few TCRs to the training data. We evaluate our model on existing databases and show that it compares favorably against other state-of-the-art models.
