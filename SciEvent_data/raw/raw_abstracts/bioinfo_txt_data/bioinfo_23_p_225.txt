Metagenomic projects often involve large numbers of large sequencing datasets (totaling hundreds of gigabytes of data). Thus, computational preprocessing and analysis are usually performed on a server. The results of such analyses are then usually explored interactively. One approach is to use MEGAN, an interactive program that allows analysis and comparison of metagenomic datasets. Previous releases have required that the user first download the computed data from the server, an increasingly time-consuming process. Here, we present MeganServer, a stand-alone program that serves MEGAN files to the web, using a RESTful API, facilitating interactive analysis in MEGAN, without requiring prior download of the data. We describe a number of different application scenarios.
