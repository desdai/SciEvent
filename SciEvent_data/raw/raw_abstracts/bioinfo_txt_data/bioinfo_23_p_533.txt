Viral genes, that are frequently small genes and/or with large overlaps, are still difficult to predict accurately. To help predict all genes in viral genomes, we provide CodingDiv that detects SNP-level microdiversity of all potential coding regions, using metagenomic reads and/or similar sequences from external databases. Protein coding regions can then be identified as the ones containing more synonymous SNPs than unfavorable nonsynonymous substitutions SNPs.
