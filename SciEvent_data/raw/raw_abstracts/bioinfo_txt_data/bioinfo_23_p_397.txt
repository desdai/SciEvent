Large-scale prediction of drug-target affinity (DTA) plays an important role in drug discovery. In recent years, machine learning algorithms have made great progress in DTA prediction by utilizing sequence or structural information of both drugs and proteins. However, sequence-based algorithms ignore the structural information of molecules and proteins, while graph-based algorithms are insufficient in feature extraction and information interaction. In this article, we propose NHGNN-DTA, a node-adaptive hybrid neural network for interpretable DTA prediction. It can adaptively acquire feature representations of drugs and proteins and allow information to interact at the graph level, effectively combining the advantages of both sequence-based and graph-based approaches. Experimental results have shown that NHGNN-DTA achieved new state-of-the-art performance. It achieved the mean squared error (MSE) of 0.196 on the Davis dataset (below 0.2 for the first time) and 0.124 on the KIBA dataset (3% improvement). Meanwhile, in the case of cold start scenario, NHGNN-DTA proved to be more robust and more effective with unseen inputs than baseline methods. Furthermore, the multi-head self-attention mechanism endows the model with interpretability, providing new exploratory insights for drug discovery. The case study on Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 illustrates the efficient utilization of drug repurposing in COVID-19.
