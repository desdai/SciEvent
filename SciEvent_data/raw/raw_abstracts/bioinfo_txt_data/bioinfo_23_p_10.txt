Somatic mutation co-occurrence has been proven to have a profound effect on tumorigenesis. While some studies have been conducted on co-mutations, a centralized resource dedicated to co-mutations in cancer is still lacking. Using multi-omics data from over 30 000 subjects and 1747 cancer cell lines, we present the Cancer co-mutation database (CoMutDB), the most comprehensive resource devoted to describing cancer co-mutations and their characteristics.
