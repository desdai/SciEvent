Codetta is a Python program for predicting the genetic code table of an organism from nucleotide sequences. Codetta can analyze an arbitrary nucleotide sequence and needs no sequence annotation or taxonomic placement. The most likely amino acid decoding for each of the 64 codons is inferred from alignments of profile hidden Markov models of conserved proteins to the input sequence.
