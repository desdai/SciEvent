iTOL is a powerful and comprehensive phylogenetic tree visualization engine. However, adjusting to new templates can be time-consuming, especially when many templates are available. We developed an R package namely itol.toolkit to help users generate all 23 types of annotation files in iTOL. This R package also provides an all-in-one data structure to store data and themes, accelerating the step from metadata to annotation files of iTOL visualizations through automatic workflows.
