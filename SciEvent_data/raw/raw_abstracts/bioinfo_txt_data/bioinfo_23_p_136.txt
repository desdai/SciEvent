The Wright-Fisher diffusion is important in population genetics in modelling the evolution of allele frequencies over time subject to the influence of biological phenomena such as selection, mutation and genetic drift. Simulating the paths of the process is challenging due to the form of the transition density. We present EWF, a robust and efficient sampler which returns exact draws for the diffusion and diffusion bridge processes, accounting for general models of selection including those with frequency dependence. Given a configuration of selection, mutation and endpoints, EWF returns draws at the requested sampling times from the law of the corresponding Wright-Fisher process. Output was validated by comparison to approximations of the transition density via the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and QQ plots.
