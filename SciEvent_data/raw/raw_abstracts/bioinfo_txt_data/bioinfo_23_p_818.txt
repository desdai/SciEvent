Gut dysbiosis is closely associated with obesity and related metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The gut microbial features and biomarkers have been increasingly investigated in many studies, which require further validation due to the limited sample size and various confounding factors that may affect microbial compositions in a single study. So far, it lacks a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline providing automated statistical analysis and integrating multiple independent studies for cross-validation simultaneously. OBMeta aims to streamline the standard metagenomics data analysis from diversity analysis, comparative analysis, and functional analysis to co-abundance network analysis. In addition, a curated database has been established with a total of 90 public research projects, covering three different phenotypes (Obesity, T2D, and NAFLD) and more than five different intervention strategies (exercise, diet, probiotics, medication, and surgery). With OBMeta, users can not only analyze their research projects but also search and match public datasets for cross-validation. Moreover, OBMeta provides cross-phenotype and cross-intervention-based advanced validation that maximally supports preliminary findings from an individual study. To summarize, OBMeta is a comprehensive web server to analyze and validate gut microbial features and biomarkers for obesity-associated metabolic diseases.
