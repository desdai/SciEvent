Plant Small Secreted Peptides (SSPs) play an important role in plant growth, development, and plant-microbe interactions. Therefore, the identification of SSPs is essential for revealing the functional mechanisms. Over the last few decades, machine learning-based methods have been developed, accelerating the discovery of SSPs to some extent. However, existing methods highly depend on handcrafted feature engineering, which easily ignores the latent feature representations and impacts the predictive performance. Here, we propose ExamPle, a novel deep learning model using Siamese network and multi-view representation for the explainable prediction of the plant SSPs. Benchmarking comparison results show that our ExamPle performs significantly better than existing methods in the prediction of plant SSPs. Also, our model shows excellent feature extraction ability. Importantly, by utilizing in silicomutagenesis experiment, ExamPle can discover sequential characteristics and identify the contribution of each amino acid for the predictions. The key novel principle learned by our model is that the head region of the peptide and some specific sequential patterns are strongly associated with the SSPs' functions. Thus, ExamPle is expected to be a useful tool for predicting plant SSPs and designing effective plant SSPs.
