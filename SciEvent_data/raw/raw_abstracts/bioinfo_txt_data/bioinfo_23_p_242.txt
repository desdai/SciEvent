Phage genome annotation plays a key role in the design of phage therapy. To date, there have been various genome annotation tools for phages, but most of these tools focus on mono-functional annotation and have complex operational processes. Accordingly, comprehensive and user-friendly platforms for phage genome annotation are needed. Here, we propose PhaGAA, an online integrated platform for phage genome annotation and analysis. By incorporating several annotation tools, PhaGAA is constructed to annotate the prophage genome at DNA and protein levels and provide the analytical results. Furthermore, PhaGAA could mine and annotate phage genomes from bacterial genome or metagenome. In summary, PhaGAA will be a useful resource for experimental biologists and help advance the phage synthetic biology in basic and application research.
