Most of the conventional deep neural network-based methods for drug-drug interaction (DDI) extraction consider only context information around drug mentions in the text. However, human experts use heterogeneous background knowledge about drugs to comprehend pharmaceutical papers and extract relationships between drugs. Therefore, we propose a novel method that simultaneously considers various heterogeneous information for DDI extraction from the literature. We first construct drug representations by conducting the link prediction task on a heterogeneous pharmaceutical knowledge graph (KG) dataset. We then effectively combine the text information of input sentences in the corpus and the information on drugs in the heterogeneous KG (HKG) dataset. Finally, we evaluate our DDI extraction method on the DDIExtraction-2013 shared task dataset. In the experiment, integrating heterogeneous drug information significantly improves the DDI extraction performance, and we achieved an F-score of 85.40%, which results in state-of-the-art performance. We evaluated our method on the DrugProt dataset and improved the performance significantly, achieving an F-score of 77.9%. Further analysis showed that each type of node in the HKG contributes to the performance improvement of DDI extraction, indicating the importance of considering multiple pieces of information.
