statistics from genome-wide association studies enable many valuable downstream analyses that are more efficient than individual-level data analysis while also reducing privacy concerns. As growing sample sizes enable better-powered analysis of gene-environment interactions, there is a need for gene-environment interaction-specific methods that manipulate and use summary statistics. We introduce two tools to facilitate such analysis, with a focus on statistical models containing multiple gene-exposure and/or gene-covariate interaction terms. REGEM (RE-analysis of GEM summary statistics) uses summary statistics from a single, multi-exposure genome-wide interaction study to derive analogous sets of summary statistics with arbitrary sets of exposures and interaction covariate adjustments. METAGEM (META-analysis of GEM summary statistics) extends current fixed-effects meta-analysis models to incorporate multiple exposures from multiple studies. We demonstrate the value and efficiency of these tools by exploring alternative methods of accounting for ancestry-related population stratification in genome-wide interaction study in the UK Biobank as well as by conducting a multi-exposure genome-wide interaction study meta-analysis in cohorts from the diabetes-focused ProDiGY consortium. These programs help to maximize the value of summary statistics from diverse and complex gene-environment interaction studies.
