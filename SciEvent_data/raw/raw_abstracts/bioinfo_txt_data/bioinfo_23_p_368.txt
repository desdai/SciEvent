Increases in the cohort size in long-read sequencing projects necessitate more efficient software for quality assessment and processing of sequencing data from Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Pacific Biosciences. Here, we describe novel tools for summarizing experiments, filtering datasets, visualizing phased alignments results, and updates to the NanoPack software suite.
