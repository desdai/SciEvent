Cosmetics form an important part of our daily lives, and it is therefore important to understand the basic physicochemical properties, metabolic pathways, and toxicological and safe concentrations of these cosmetics molecules. Therefore, comprehensive cosmetic ingredients bioinformatics platform (CCIBP) was developed here, which is a unique comprehensive cosmetic database providing information on regulations, physicochemical properties, and human metabolic pathways for cosmetic molecules from major regions of the world, whilst also correlating plant information in natural products. CCIBP supports formulation analysis, efficacy component analysis, and also combines knowledge of synthetic biology to facilitate access to natural molecules and biosynthetic production. CCIBP, empowered with chemoinformatics, bioinformatics, and synthetic biology data and tools, presents a very helpful platform for cosmetic research and development of ingredients.
