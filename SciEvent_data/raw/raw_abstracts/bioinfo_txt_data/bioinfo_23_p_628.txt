A single gene may yield several isoforms with different functions through alternative splicing. Continuous efforts are devoted to developing machine-learning methods to predict isoform functions. However, existing methods do not consider the relevance of each feature to specific functions and ignore the noise caused by the irrelevant features. In this case, we hypothesize that constructing a feature selection framework to extract the function-relevant features might help improve the model accuracy in isoform function prediction. In this article, we present a feature selection-based approach named IsoFrog to predict isoform functions. First, IsoFrog adopts a reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC)-based feature selection framework to assess the feature importance to gene functions. Second, a sequential feature selection procedure is applied to select a subset of function-relevant features. This strategy screens the relevant features for the specific function while eliminating irrelevant ones, improving the effectiveness of the input features. Then, the selected features are input into our proposed method modified domain-invariant partial least squares, which prioritizes the most likely positive isoform for each positive MIG and utilizes diPLS for isoform function prediction. Tested on three datasets, our method achieves superior performance over six state-of-the-art methods, and the RJMCMC-based feature selection framework outperforms three classic feature selection methods. We expect this proposed methodology will promote the identification of isoform functions and further inspire the development of new methods.
