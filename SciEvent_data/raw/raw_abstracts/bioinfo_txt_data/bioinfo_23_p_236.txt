Annotation of nonmodel organisms is an open problem, especially the detection of untranslated regions (UTRs). Correct annotation of UTRs is crucial in transcriptomic analysis to accurately capture the expression of each gene yet is mostly overlooked in annotation pipelines. Here we present peaks2utr, an easy-to-use Python command line tool that uses the UTR enrichment of single-cell technologies, such as 10Ã— Chromium, to accurately annotate 3' UTRs for a given canonical annotation.
