Iso-Seq RNA long-read sequencing enables the identification of full-length transcripts and isoforms, removing the need for complex analysis such as transcriptome assembly. However, the raw sequencing data need to be processed in a series of steps before annotation is complete. Here, we present nf-core/isoseq, a pipeline for automatic read processing and genome annotation. Following nf-core guidelines, the pipeline has few dependencies and can be run on any of platforms.
