We recently introduced the Gut Microbiome Wellness Index (GMWI), a stool metagenome-based indicator for assessing health by determining the likelihood of disease given the state of one's gut microbiome. The calculation of our wellness index depends on the relative abundances of health-prevalent and health-scarce species. Encouragingly, GMWI has already been utilized in various studies focusing on differences in the gut microbiome between cases and controls. Herein, we introduce the GMWI-webtool, a user-friendly browser application that computes GMWI, health-prevalent/-scarce species' relative abundances, and Î±-diversities from stool shotgun metagenome taxonomic profiles. Users of our interactive online tool can visualize their results and compare them side-by-side with those from our pooled reference dataset of metagenomes, as well as export data in.csv format and high-resolution figures.
