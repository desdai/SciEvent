Densely measured SNP data are routinely analyzed but face challenges due to its high dimensionality, especially when gene-environment interactions are incorporated. In recent literature, a functional analysis strategy has been developed, which treats dense SNP measurements as a realization of a genetic function and can 'bypass' the dimensionality challenge. However, there is a lack of portable and friendly software, which hinders practical utilization of these functional methods. We fill this knowledge gap and develop the R package FunctanSNP. This comprehensive package encompasses estimation, identification, and visualization tools and has undergone extensive testing using both simulated and real data, confirming its reliability. FunctanSNP can serve as a convenient and reliable tool for analyzing SNP and other densely measured data.
