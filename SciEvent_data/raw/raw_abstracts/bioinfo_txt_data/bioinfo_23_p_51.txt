Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) holds great promises for investigating DNA methylation with high sensitivity. Yet, the lack of methods for analyzing ddPCR DNA methylation data has resulted in users processing the data manually at the expense of standardization. PoDCall is an R package performing automated calling of positive droplets, quantification and normalization of methylation levels in ddPCR experiments. A Shiny application provides users with an intuitive and interactive interface to access PoDCall functionalities.
