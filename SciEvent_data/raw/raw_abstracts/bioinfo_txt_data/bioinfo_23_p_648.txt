The maturation of systems immunology methodologies requires novel and transparent computational frameworks capable of integrating diverse data modalities in a reproducible manner. Here, we present the ePlatypus computational immunology ecosystem for immunogenomics data analysis, with a focus on adaptive immune repertoires and single-cell sequencing. ePlatypus is an open-source web-based platform and provides programming tutorials and an integrative database that helps elucidate signatures of B and T cell clonal selection. Furthermore, the ecosystem links novel and established bioinformatics pipelines relevant for single-cell immune repertoires and other aspects of computational immunology such as predicting ligand-receptor interactions, structural modeling, simulations, machine learning, graph theory, pseudotime, spatial transcriptomics, and phylogenetics. The ePlatypus ecosystem helps extract deeper insight in computational immunology and immunogenomics and promote open science.
