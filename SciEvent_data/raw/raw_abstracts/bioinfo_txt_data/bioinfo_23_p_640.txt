We present PyDESeq2, a python implementation of the DESeq2 workflow for differential expression analysis on bulk RNA-seq data. This re-implementation yields similar, but not identical, results: it achieves higher model likelihood, allows speed improvements on large datasets, as shown in experiments on TCGA data, and can be more easily interfaced with modern python-based data science tools.
