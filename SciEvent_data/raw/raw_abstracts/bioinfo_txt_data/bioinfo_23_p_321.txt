The transition from evaluating a single time point to examining the entire dynamic evolution of a system is possible only in the presence of the proper framework. The strong variability of dynamic evolution makes the definition of an explanatory procedure for data fitting and clustering challenging. We developed CONNECTOR, a data-driven framework able to analyze and inspect longitudinal data in a straightforward and revealing way. When used to analyze tumor growth kinetics over time in 1599 patient-derived xenograft growth curves from ovarian and colorectal cancers, CONNECTOR allowed the aggregation of time-series data through an unsupervised approach in informative clusters. We give a new perspective of mechanism interpretation, specifically, we define novel model aggregations and we identify unanticipated molecular associations with response to clinically approved therapies.
