Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of cell membranes allow for a better understanding of complex processes such as changing membrane dynamics, lipid rafts and the incorporation/passing of macromolecules into/through membranes. To explore and understand cell membrane compositions, dynamics and processes, visual analytics can help to interpret MD simulation data. APL@Voro is a software for the interactive visualization and analysis of cell membrane simulations. Here, we present the new APL@Voro, which has been continuously developed since its initial release in 2013. We discuss newly implemented algorithms, methodologies and features, such as the interactive comparison of related simulations and methods to assign lipids to either the upper or lower leaflet.
