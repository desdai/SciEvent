Data from the American Association for Cancer Research Project Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange Biopharma Collaborative (GENIE BPC) represent comprehensive clinical data linked to high-throughput sequencing data, providing a multi-institution, pan-cancer, publicly available data repository. GENIE BPC data provide detailed demographic, clinical, treatment, genomic and outcome data for patients with cancer. These data result in a unique observational database of molecularly characterized tumors with comprehensive clinical annotation that can be used for health outcomes and precision medicine research in oncology. Due to the inherently complex structure of the multiple phenomic and genomic datasets, the use of these data requires a robust process for data integration and preparation in order to build analytic models. We present the {genieBPC} package, a user-friendly data processing pipeline to facilitate the creation of analytic cohorts from the GENIE BPC data that are ready for clinico-genomic modeling and analyses.
