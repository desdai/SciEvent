Multimodal single-cell sequencing data provide detailed views into the molecular biology of cells. To allow for interactive analyses of such rich data and to readily derive insights from it, new analysis solutions are required. In this work, we present Cellenium, our new scalable visual analytics web application that enables users to semantically integrate and organize all their single-cell RNA-, ATAC-, and CITE-sequencing studies. Users can then find relevant studies and analyze single-cell data within and across studies. An interactive cell annotation feature allows for adding user-defined cell types.
