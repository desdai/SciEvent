Target discovery and drug evaluation for diseases with complex mechanisms call for a streamlined chemical systems analysis platform. Currently available tools lack the emphasis on reaction kinetics, access to relevant databases, and algorithms to visualize perturbations on a chemical scale providing quantitative details as well streamlined visual data analytics functionality. CytoCopasi, a Maven-based application for Cytoscape that combines the chemical systems analysis features of COPASI with the visualization and database access tools of Cytoscape and its plugin applications has been developed. The diverse functionality of CytoCopasi through ab initio model construction, model construction via pathway and parameter databases KEGG and BRENDA is presented. The comparative systems biology visualization analysis toolset is illustrated through a drug competence study on the cancerous RAF/MEK/ERK pathway.
