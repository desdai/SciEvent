The Synthetic Biology Open Language version 3 data standard provides a graph-based approach to exchange information about biological designs. The new data model has major updates and offers several features for software tools. Here, we present libSBOLj3 to facilitate data exchange and provide interoperability between computer-aided design and automation tools using this standard. The library adopts a graph-based approach. Tool developers can extend these graphs with application-specific information and use detailed validation reports to identify errors and interoperability issues and apply best practice rules.
