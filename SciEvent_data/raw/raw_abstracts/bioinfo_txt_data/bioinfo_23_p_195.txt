We present NMRtist, an online platform that combines deep learning, large-scale optimization and cloud computing to automate protein NMR spectra analysis. Our website provides virtual storage for NMR spectra deposition together with a set of applications designed for automated peak picking, chemical shift assignment and protein structure determination. The system can be used by non-experts and allows protein assignments and structures to be determined within hours after the measurements, strictly without any human intervention.
