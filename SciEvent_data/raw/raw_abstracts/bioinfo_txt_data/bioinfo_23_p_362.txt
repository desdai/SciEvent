The advent of long-read DNA sequencing is allowing complete assembly of highly repetitive genomic regions for the first time, including the megabase-scale satellite repeat arrays found in many eukaryotic centromeres. The assembly of such repetitive regions creates a need for their de novo annotation, including patterns of higher order repetition. To annotate tandem repeats, methods are required that can be widely applied to diverse genome sequences, without prior knowledge of monomer sequences. Tandem Repeat Annotation and Structural Hierarchy (TRASH) is a tool that identifies and maps tandem repeats in nucleotide sequence, without prior knowledge of repeat composition. TRASH analyses a fasta assembly file, identifies regions occupied by repeats and then precisely maps them and their higher order structures. To demonstrate the applicability and scalability of TRASH for centromere research, we apply our method to the recently published Col-CEN genome of Arabidopsis thaliana and the complete human CHM13 genome.
