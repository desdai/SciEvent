Beyond identifying genetic variants, we introduce a set of Boolean relations, which allows for a comprehensive classification of the relations of every pair of variants by taking all minimal alignments into account. We present an efficient algorithm to compute these relations, including a novel way of efficiently computing all minimal alignments within the best theoretical complexity bounds. We show that these relations are common, and many non-trivial, for variants of the CFTR gene in dbSNP. Ultimately, we present an approach for the storing and indexing of variants in the context of a database that enables efficient querying for all these relations.
