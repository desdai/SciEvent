Native top-down proteomics (nTDP) integrates native mass spectrometry (nMS) with top-down proteomics (TDP) to provide comprehensive analysis of protein complexes together with proteoform identification and characterization. Despite significant advances in nMS and TDP software developments, a unified and user-friendly software package for analysis of nTDP data remains lacking. We have developed MASH Native to provide a unified solution for nTDP to process complex datasets with database searching capabilities in a user-friendly interface. MASH Native supports various data formats and incorporates multiple options for deconvolution, database searching, and spectral summing to provide a "one-stop shop" for characterizing both native protein complexes and proteoforms.
