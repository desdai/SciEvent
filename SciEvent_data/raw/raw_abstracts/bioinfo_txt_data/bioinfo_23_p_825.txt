In this article, we present IntelliGenes, a novel machine learning (ML) pipeline for the multi-genomics exploration to discover biomarkers significant in disease prediction with high accuracy. IntelliGenes is based on a novel approach, which consists of nexus of conventional statistical techniques and cutting-edge ML algorithms using multi-genomic, clinical, and demographic data. IntelliGenes introduces a new metric, i.e. Intelligent Gene (I-Gene) score to measure the importance of individual biomarkers for prediction of complex traits. I-Gene scores can be utilized to generate I-Gene profiles of individuals to comprehend the intricacies of ML used in disease prediction. IntelliGenes is user-friendly, portable, and a cross-platform application, compatible with Microsoft Windows, macOS, and UNIX operating systems. IntelliGenes not only holds the potential for personalized early detection of common and rare diseases in individuals, but also opens avenues for broader research using novel ML methodologies, ultimately leading to personalized interventions and novel treatment targets.
