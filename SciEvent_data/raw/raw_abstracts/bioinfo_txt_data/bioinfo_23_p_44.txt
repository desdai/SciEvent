The NanoTube is an open-source pipeline that simplifies the processing, quality control, normalization and analysis of NanoString nCounter gene expression data. It is implemented in an extensible R library, which performs a variety of gene expression analysis techniques and contains additional functions for integration with other R libraries performing advanced NanoString analysis techniques. Additionally, the NanoTube web application is available as a simple tool for researchers without programming expertise.
