Large-scale sharing of genomic quantification data requires standardized access interfaces. In this Global Alliance for Genomics and Health project, we developed RNAget, an API for secure access to genomic quantification data in matrix form. RNAget provides for slicing matrices to extract desired subsets of data and is applicable to all expression matrix-format data, including RNA sequencing and microarrays. Further, it generalizes to quantification matrices of other sequence-based genomics such as ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq.
