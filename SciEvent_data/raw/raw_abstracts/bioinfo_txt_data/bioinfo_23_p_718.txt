Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are a way of describing the interaction between genes, which contribute to revealing the different biological mechanisms in the cell. Reconstructing GRNs based on gene expression data has been a central computational problem in systems biology. However, due to the high dimensionality and non-linearity of large-scale GRNs, accurately and efficiently inferring GRNs is still a challenging task. In this article, we propose a new approach, iLSGRN, to reconstruct large-scale GRNs from steady-state and time-series gene expression data based on non-linear ordinary differential equations. Firstly, the regulatory gene recognition algorithm calculates the Maximal Information Coefficient between genes and excludes redundant regulatory relationships to achieve dimensionality reduction. Then, the feature fusion algorithm constructs a model leveraging the feature importance derived from XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) and RF (Random Forest) models, which can effectively train the non-linear ordinary differential equations model of GRNs and improve the accuracy and stability of the inference algorithm. The extensive experiments on different scale datasets show that our method makes sensible improvement compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we perform cross-validation experiments on the real gene datasets to validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method.
