Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) is frequently used to identify modules of genes that are co-expressed across many RNA-seq samples. However, the current R implementation is slow, is not designed to compare modules between multiple WGCNA networks, and its results can be hard to interpret as well as to visualize. We introduce the PyWGCNA Python package, which is designed to identify co-expression modules from large RNA-seq datasets. PyWGCNA has a faster implementation than the R version of WGCNA and several additional downstream analysis modules for functional enrichment analysis using GO, KEGG, and REACTOME, inter-module analysis of protein-protein interactions, as well as comparison of multiple co-expression modules to each other and/or external lists of genes such as marker genes from single cell. We apply PyWGCNA to two distinct datasets of brain bulk RNA-seq from MODEL-AD to identify modules associated with the genotypes. We compare the resulting modules to each other to find shared co-expression signatures in the form of modules with significant overlap across the datasets.
