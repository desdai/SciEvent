Non-coding RNAs play important roles in transcriptional processes and participate in the regulation of various biological functions, in particular miRNAs and lncRNAs. Despite their importance for several biological functions, the existing signaling pathway databases do not include information on miRNA and lncRNA. Here, we redesigned a novel pathway database named NcPath by integrating and visualizing a total of 178 308 human experimentally validated miRNA-target interactions (MTIs), 32 282 experimentally verified lncRNA-target interactions (LTIs) and 4837 experimentally validated human ceRNA networks across 222 KEGG pathways (including 27 sub-categories). To expand the application potential of the redesigned NcPath database, we identified 556 798 reliable lncRNA-protein-coding genes (PCG) interaction pairs by integrating co-expression relations, ceRNA relations, co-TF-binding interactions, co-histone-modification interactions, cis-regulation relations and lncPro Tool predictions between lncRNAs and PCG. In addition, to determine the pathways in which miRNA/lncRNA targets are involved, we performed a KEGG enrichment analysis using a hypergeometric test. The NcPath database also provides information on MTIs/LTIs/ceRNA networks, PubMed IDs, gene annotations and the experimental verification method used. In summary, the NcPath database will serve as an important and continually updated platform that provides annotation and visualization of the pathways on which non-coding RNAs (miRNA and lncRNA) are involved, and provide support to multimodal non-coding RNAs enrichment analysis.
