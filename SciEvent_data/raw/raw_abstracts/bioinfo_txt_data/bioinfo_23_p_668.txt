TAD boundaries are essential for organizing the chromatin spatial structure and regulating gene expression in eukaryotes. However, for large-scale pan-3D genome research, identifying conserved and specific TAD boundaries across different species or individuals is computationally challenging. Here, we present Tcbf, a rapid and powerful Python/R tool that integrates gene synteny blocks and homologous sequences to automatically detect conserved and specific TAD boundaries among multiple species, which can efficiently analyze huge genome datasets, greatly reduce the computational burden and enable pan-3D genome research.
