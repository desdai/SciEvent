BondGraphs.jl is a Julia implementation of bond graphs. Bond graphs provide a modelling framework that describes energy flow through a physical system and by construction enforce thermodynamic constraints. The framework is widely used in engineering and has recently been shown to be a powerful approach for modelling biology. Models are mutable, hierarchical, multiscale, and multiphysics, and BondGraphs.jl is compatible with the Julia modelling ecosystem.
