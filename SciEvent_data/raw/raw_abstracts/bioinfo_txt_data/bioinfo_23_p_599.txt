Protein thermostability is of great interest, both in theory and in practice. This study compared orthologous proteins with different cellular thermostability. A large number of physicochemical properties of protein were calculated and used to develop a series of machine learning models for predicting cellular thermostability differences between orthologous proteins. Most of the important features in these models are also highly correlated to relative cellular thermostability. A comparison between the present study with previous comparison of orthologous proteins from thermophilic and mesophilic organisms found that most highly correlated features are consistent in these studies, suggesting they may be important to protein thermostability.
