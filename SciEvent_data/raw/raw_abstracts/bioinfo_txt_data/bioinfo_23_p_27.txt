scFates provides an extensive toolset for the analysis of dynamic trajectories comprising tree learning, feature association testing, branch differential expression and with a focus on cell biasing and fate splits at the level of bifurcations. It is meant to be fully integrated into the scanpy ecosystem for seamless analysis of trajectories from single-cell data of various modalities (e.g. RNA and ATAC).
