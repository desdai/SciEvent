We present ROBUST-Web which implements our recently presented ROBUST disease module mining algorithm in a user-friendly web application. ROBUST-Web features seamless downstream disease module exploration via integrated gene set enrichment analysis, tissue expression annotation, and visualization of drug-protein and disease-gene links. Moreover, ROBUST-Web includes bias-aware edge costs for the underlying Steiner tree model as a new algorithmic feature, which allow to correct for study bias in protein-protein interaction networks and further improves the robustness of the computed modules.
