The chem16S package combines taxonomic classifications of 16S rRNA gene sequences with amino acid compositions of prokaryotic reference proteomes to generate community reference proteomes. Taxonomic classifications from the RDP Classifier or data objects created by the phyloseq R package are supported. Users can calculate and visualize a variety of chemical metrics in order to explore the effects of redox, salinity, and other physicochemical variables on the genomic adaptation of protein sequences at the community level.
