While classical approaches for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) of RNA sequencing (RNAseq) experiments have been well described, modern research workflows and growing databases enable a new paradigm of controlling the FDR globally across RNAseq experiments in the past, present and future. The simplest analysis strategy that analyses each RNAseq experiment separately and applies an FDR correction method can lead to inflation of the overall FDR. We propose applying recently developed methodology for online multiple hypothesis testing to control the global FDR in a principled way across multiple RNAseq experiments. We show that repeated application of classical repeated offline approaches has variable control of global FDR of RNAseq experiments over time. We demonstrate that the online FDR algorithms are a principled way to control FDR. Furthermore, in certain simulation scenarios, we observe empirically that online approaches have comparable power to repeated offline approaches.
