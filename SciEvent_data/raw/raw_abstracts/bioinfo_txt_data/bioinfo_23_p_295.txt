SpliceAI is a widely used splicing prediction tool and its most common application relies on the maximum delta score to assign variant impact on splicing. We developed the SpliceAI-10k calculator (SAI-10k-calc) to extend use of this tool to predict: the splicing aberration type including pseudoexonization, intron retention, partial exon deletion, and (multi)exon skipping using a 10 kb analysis window; the size of inserted or deleted sequence; the effect on reading frame; and the altered amino acid sequence. SAI-10k-calc has 95% sensitivity and 96% specificity for predicting variants that impact splicing, computed from a control dataset of 1212 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) with curated splicing assay results. Notably, it has high performance (â‰¥84% accuracy) for predicting pseudoexon and partial intron retention. The automated amino acid sequence prediction allows for efficient identification of variants that are expected to result in mRNA nonsense-mediated decay or translation of truncated proteins.
