The recent availability of omics data allows the construction of holistic maps of interactions between numerous role-playing biomolecules. However, these networks are often static, ignoring the dynamic behavior of biological processes. On the other hand, dynamic models are commonly constructed on small scales. Hence, the construction of large-scale dynamic models that can quantitatively predict the time-course cellular behaviors remains a big challenge. In this study, a pipeline is proposed for the automatic construction of large-scale dynamic models. The pipeline uses a list of biomolecules and their time-course trajectories in a given phenomenon as input. First, the interaction network of the biomolecules is constructed. To state the underlying molecular events of each interaction, it is translated into a map of biochemical reactions. Next, to define the kinetics of the reactions, an ordinary differential equation (ODE) is generated for each involved biomolecule. Finally, the parameters of the ODE system are estimated by a novel large-scale parameter approximation method. The high performance of the pipeline is demonstrated by modeling the response of a colorectal cancer cell line to different chemotherapy regimens. In conclusion, Systematic Protein Association Dynamic ANalyzer constructs genome-scale dynamic models, filling the gap between large-scale static and small-scale dynamic modeling strategies. This simulation approach allows for holistic quantitative predictions which are critical for the simulation of therapeutic interventions in precision medicine.
