Biological pattern formation is one of the complex system phenomena in nature, requiring theoretical analysis based on mathematical modeling and computer simulations for in-depth understanding. We propose a Python framework named LPF to systematically explore the highly diverse wing color patterns of ladybirds using reaction-diffusion models. LPF supports GPU-accelerated array computing for numerical analysis of partial differential equation models, concise visualization of ladybird morphs, and evolutionary algorithms for searching mathematical models with deep learning models for computer vision.
