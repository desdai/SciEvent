Transcriptome-wide detection of binding sites of RNA-binding proteins is achieved using Individual-nucleotide crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) and its derivative enhanced CLIP (eCLIP) sequencing methods. Here, we introduce htseq-clip, a python package developed for preprocessing, extracting and summarizing crosslink site counts from i/eCLIP experimental data. The package delivers crosslink site count matrices along with other metrics, which can be directly used for filtering and downstream analyses such as the identification of differential binding sites.
