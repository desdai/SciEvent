Experimental methods using microRNA/target ligation have recently provided significant insights into microRNA functioning through generation of chimeric (hybrid) RNA sequences. Here, we introduce Hybkit, a Python3 API, and command-line toolkit for analysis of hybrid sequence data in the "hyb" file format to enable customizable evaluation and annotation of hybrid characteristics. The Hybkit API includes a suite of python objects for developing custom analyses of hybrid data as well as miRNA-specific analysis methods, built-in plotting of analysis results, and incorporation of predicted miRNA/target interactions in Vienna format.
