Genomic data are often processed in batches and analyzed together to save time. However, it is challenging to combine multiple large VCFs and properly handle imputation quality and missing variants due to the limitations of available tools. To address these concerns, we developed IMMerge, a Python-based tool that takes advantage of multiprocessing to reduce running time. For the first time in a publicly available tool, imputation quality scores are correctly combined with Fisher's z transformation.
