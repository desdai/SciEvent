We face an increasing flood of genetic sequence data, from diverse sources, requiring rapid computational analysis. Rapid analysis can be achieved by sampling a subset of positions in each sequence. Previous sequence-sampling methods, such as minimizers, syncmers and minimally overlapping words, were developed by heuristic intuition, and are not optimal. We present a sequence-sampling approach that provably optimizes sensitivity for a whole class of sequence comparison methods, for randomly evolving sequences. It is likely near-optimal for a wide range of alignment-based and alignment-free analyses. For real biological DNA, it increases specificity by avoiding simple repeats. Our approach generalizes universal hitting sets (which guarantee to sample a sequence at least once) and polar sets (which guarantee to sample a sequence at most once). This helps us understand how to do rapid sequence analysis as accurately as possible.
