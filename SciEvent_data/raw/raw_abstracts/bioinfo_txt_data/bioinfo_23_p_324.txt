The discovery of differential gene-gene correlations across phenotypical groups can help identify the activation/deactivation of critical biological processes underlying specific conditions. The presented R package, provided with a count and design matrix, extract networks of group-specific interactions that can be interactively explored through a shiny user-friendly interface. For each gene-gene link, differential statistical significance is provided through robust linear regression with an interaction term.
