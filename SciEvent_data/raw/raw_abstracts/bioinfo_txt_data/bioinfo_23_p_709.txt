Spatially resolved transcriptomics technologies generate gene expression data with retained positional information from a tissue section, often accompanied by a corresponding histological image. Computational tools should make it effortless to incorporate spatial information into data analyses and present analysis results in their histological context. Here, we present semla, an R package for processing, analysis, and visualization of spatially resolved transcriptomics data generated by the Visium platform, that includes interactive web applications for data exploration and tissue annotation.
