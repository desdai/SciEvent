This study explores the global phenomenon of migration at the local, neighborhood level of a mid-sized city in Germany. Focusing on a long-term interactive storytelling-initiative, it studies the emergence of Arrival Literacy as a bi-directional skill-set. It describes the development of individual, local responses to global migration consequences, among both newcomers who migrated, as well as long-term citizens who never moved. The analytic lens of Arrival Literacy brings forward the complexity and difficulties of the arrival process, where the individual is navigating the consequences of political decisions that were made at a broader level. Digital storytelling as an element is a method to 1) creatively develop a skill of expression for one's own positionality, and 2) to connect with the positionalities of others, thus supporting the process of dealing with arrival at the local community level and beyond.
