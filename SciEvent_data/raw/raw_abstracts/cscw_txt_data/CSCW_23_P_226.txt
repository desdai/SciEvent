Past and current research has shown that Knowledge and Expertise Sharing (KES) is central to the appropriation of enterprise software such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. ERP implementation projects in Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are often driven by research and practice. However, they tend to focus on the 'go live' moment rather than on the subsequent, much longer post-implementation phase. This, we argue, results in decreased utilisation over time and an increased need for workarounds. In this paper, we draw on an empirical study within four organisations which exposes the limitations of KES in ERP implementation projects in SMEs, especially in regard to the preparation of key users. Our findings suggest that, despite key users' essential role in these projects, they are often chosen haphazardly and are ill-prepared. As a result, they cannot fulfil their role of facilitating KES with end users, who end up appropriating ERP systems mostly through 'learning by doing'. This stems directly from complex and largely unrecognised processes involving consultants, hotlines, management, key users and end users. In this paper, we introduce and discuss specific socio-technical, KES-oriented measures which can potentially lead to sustainable KES throughout the ERP life-cycle for longer-term success.
