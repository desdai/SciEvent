Almost half of the preventable deaths in emergency care can be associated with a medical delay. Understanding how clinicians experience delays can lead to improved alert designs to increase delay awareness and mitigation. In this paper, we present the findings from an iterative user-centered design process involving 48 clinicians to develop a prototype alert system for supporting delay awareness in complex medical teamwork such as trauma resuscitation. We used semi-structured interviews and card-sorting workshops to identify the most common delays and elicit design requirements for the prototype alert system. We then conducted a survey to refine the alert designs, followed by near-live, video-guided simulations to investigate clinicians' reactions to the alerts. We contribute to CSCW by designing a prototype alert system to support delay awareness in time-critical, complex teamwork and identifying four mechanisms through which teams mitigate delays.
