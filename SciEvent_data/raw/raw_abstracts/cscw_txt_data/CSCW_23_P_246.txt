Recent interest in design through the artificial intelligence (AI) lens is rapidly increasing. Designers, as a special user group interacting with AI, have received more attention in the Human-Computer Interaction community. Prior work has discussed emerging challenges that persist in designing for AI. However, few systematic reviews focus on AI for design to understand how designers and AI can augment each other's complementary strengths in design collaboration. In this work, we conducted a landscape analysis of AI for design, via a systematic literature review of 93 papers. The analysis first provides a bird's eye view of overall patterns in this area. The analysis also reveals three themes interpreted from the paper corpus associated with AI for design, including AI assisting designers, designers assisting AI, and characterizing designer-AI collaboration. We discuss the implications of our findings and suggested methodological proposals to guide HCI toward research and practices that center on collaborative creativity.
