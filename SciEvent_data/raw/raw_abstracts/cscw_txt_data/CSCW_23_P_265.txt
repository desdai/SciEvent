Virtual romance service (VRS), as a notable commodification of intimacy, is currently emerging in China. Such service is not similar to the kind of intimacy that fans and idols generate through parasocial relationships, but behaves as the direct dyadic intimacy between service providers (virtual lovers) and buyers (customers). To gain a deep understanding of computer-mediated paid companionship, we study emerging user behaviors in VRS through a mixed-method study, including a survey (N = 178) and a follow-up semi-structured interview (N = 22) with both virtual lovers and customers to learn about their motivations, perceptions, and how virtual lovers provide online paid companionship to meet customers' emotional needs. We found three behavioral strategies of virtual lovers and the fact that they provide service in surface and deep acting and real feeling. Customers see VRS as a way to obtain affective benefits with reduced affective cost. We also found that VRS customers paid for the tangible benefits of an idealized romantic partner, rather than long-term commitment and emotional investment, and we identified key characteristics that VRS reduces from intimate relationships that fit its pay-per-use feature. We conclude by discussing the nature of virtual lovers and design implications for computer-mediated paid companionship.
