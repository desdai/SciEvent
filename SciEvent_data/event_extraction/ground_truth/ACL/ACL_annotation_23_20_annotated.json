However, such models can fail to produce output faithful to the input data, particularly on out-of-domain data. Sufficient annotated data is often not available for specific domains, leading us to seek an unsupervised approach to improve the faithfulness of output text. Since the problem is fundamentally one of consistency between the representations of the structured data and text, we evaluate the effectiveness of cycle training in this work. Cycle training uses two models which are inverses of each other: one that generates text from structured data, and one which generates the structured data from natural language text. We show that cycle training, when initialized with a small amount of supervised data (100 samples in our case), achieves nearly the same performance as fully supervised approaches for the data-to-text generation task on the WebNLG, E2E, WTQ, and WSQL datasets. We perform extensive empirical analysis with automated evaluation metrics and a newly designed human evaluation schema to reveal different cycle training strategies’ effectiveness of reducing various types of generation errors.",

Robust transfer of linguistic features across different datasets orbiting the same goal carries potential to address this concern. To test this hypothesis, we experiment with domain adaptation (DA) techniques on heterogeneous spoken language data to evaluate generalizability across diverse datasets for a common task: dementia detection. We find that adapted models exhibit better performance across conversational and task-oriented datasets. The feature-augmented DA method achieves a 22% increase in accuracy adapting from a conversational to task-specific dataset compared to a jointly trained baseline.
