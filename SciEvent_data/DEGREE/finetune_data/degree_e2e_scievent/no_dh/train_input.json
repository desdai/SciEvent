    "This study aims to systematically map the literature on people\u2019s experiences of using digital MBIs that target psychosocial variables (e.g., anxiety, depression, distress, and well-being) and identify key barriers to and facilitators of engagement. We conducted a scoping review to synthesize empirical qualitative research on people\u2019s experiences of using digital MBIs. We adopted a streamlined approach to ensure that the evidence could be incorporated into the early stages of intervention development. The search strategy identified articles with at least one keyword related to mindfulness, digital, user experience, and psychosocial variables in their title or abstract. Inclusion criteria specified that articles must have a qualitative component, report on participants\u2019 experiences of using a digital MBI designed to improve psychosocial variables, and have a sample age range that at least partially overlapped with 16 to 35 years. Qualitative data on user experience were charted and analyzed using inductive thematic synthesis to generate understandings that go beyond the content of the original studies.

To achieve our goal, we first utilize causal intervention to remove the psycholinguistic bias which introduces the spurious correlations between text features and news label.

Another example is the ambiguity regarding the definition of medical risk groups prioritized for vaccination, with many citizens not meeting the formal priority criteria while being equally at risk. Such experiential knowledge may help the early identification of problems with the guideline\u2019s application and point to frequently occurring exceptions that might initiate a revision of the guideline text.\n The event expresses conclusions or broader implications.\n Similar triggers such as suggest, conclude, implication, recommend\n Event trigger is <Trigger>\n someone or something discusses something and/with/for another thing in context of some context using some method.

    "In this work, we define a typology for three types of label biases in ICL for text classification: vanilla-label bias, context-label bias, and domain-label bias (which we conceptualize and detect for the first time). Our analysis demonstrates that prior label bias calibration methods fall short of addressing all three types of biases. Specifically, domain-label bias restricts LLMs to random-level performance on many tasks regardless of the choice of in-context examples. To mitigate the effect of these biases, we propose a simple bias calibration method that estimates a language model\u2019s label bias using random in-domain words from the task corpus. After controlling for this estimated bias when making predictions, our novel domain-context calibration significantly improves the ICL performance of GPT-J and GPT-3 on a wide range of tasks.\n The event describes the methodological approach.\n Similar triggers such as use, present, propose, introduce, analyze\n Event trigger is <Trigger>\n someone or something discusses something and/with/for another thing in context of some context using some method.

    "Next, our interviews reveal that Reddit moderators rely on two types of crowd wisdom for misinformation detection. Almost all participants are heavily reliant on reports from crowds of ordinary users to identify potential misinformation. A second crowd--participants' own moderation teams and expert moderators of other communities--provide support when participants encounter difficult, ambiguous cases. Finally, we use design probes to better understand how different types of crowd signals---from ordinary users and moderators---readily available on Reddit can assist moderators with identifying misinformation.

Portals mostly provided educational, monitoring, and communication-related features. Studies reported on usage behavior including associated variables, usability dimensions, and suggestions for improvement. Various ways of reporting usage frequency were identified. A noticeable decline in portal usage over time was reported frequently. Age was most frequently studied in association with portal use, followed by gender, education, and eHealth literacy. Younger age and higher education were often associated with higher portal use.

    "Accuracy is improved from 84% to 95% on the prediction of EC numbers at level two on the EC40 benchmark. To evaluate the prediction quality at level four, the most detailed level of EC numbers, we built two new time-based benchmarks for comparison with state-of-the-art methods ECPred and DeepEC: the macro-F1 score is respectively improved from 41% to 54% and from 20% to 26%. Finally, we also show that using a simple combination of attention maps is on par with, or better than, other classical interpretability methods on the EC prediction task. More specifically, important residues identified by attention maps tend to correspond to known catalytic sites.

We further propose a smoothing loss that smooths the loss distribution of the suffix tokens to make it easier to sample the correct suffix. In order to select the most probable suffix from a collection of sampled suffixes and estimate the prediction confidence, we propose a calibrated confidence estimation method, which normalizes the confidence of the generated suffixes with a local estimation.\n The event describes the methodological approach.\n Similar triggers such as use, present, propose, introduce, analyze\n Event trigger is <Trigger>\n someone or something discusses something and/with/for another thing in context of some context using some method.

    "In this work, we construct a new dataset called SafeConv for the research of conversational safety: (1) Besides the utterance-level safety labels, SafeConv also provides unsafe spans in an utterance, information able to indicate which words contribute to the detected unsafe behavior; (2) SafeConv provides safe alternative responses to continue the conversation when unsafe behavior detected, guiding the conversation to a gentle trajectory. By virtue of the comprehensive annotation of SafeConv, we benchmark three powerful models for the mitigation of conversational unsafe behavior, including a checker to detect unsafe utterances, a tagger to extract unsafe spans, and a rewriter to convert an unsafe response to a safe version.

    "First, the complexity and poor reproducibility of microscopic image examination are due to the cell type diversity, delicate intralineage discrepancy within the multitype cell maturation process, cells overlapping, lipid interference and stain variation. Second, manual annotation on whole-slide images is tedious, laborious and subject to intraobserver variability, which causes the supervised information restricted to limited, easily identifiable and scattered cells annotated by humans. Third, when the training data are sparsely labeled, many unlabeled objects of interest are wrongly defined as background, which severely confuses AI learners.

    "Social prescription programs represent a viable solution to linking primary care patients to nonmedical community resources for improving patient well-being. However, their success depends on the integration of patient needs with local resources. This integration could be accelerated by digital tools that use expressive ontology to organize knowledge resources, thus enabling the seamless navigation of diverse community interventions and services tailored to the needs of individual users.

    "A total of 2.18% (34/1561) of the screened articles were included in the final review. The authors reported FAIRification approaches, which include interpolation, inclusion of comprehensive data dictionaries, repository design, semantic interoperability, ontologies, data quality, linked data, and requirement gathering for FAIRification tools. Challenges and mitigation strategies associated with FAIRification, such as high setup costs, data politics, technical and administrative issues, privacy concerns, and difficulties encountered in sharing health data despite its sensitive nature were also reported. We found various workflows, tools, and infrastructures designed by different groups worldwide to facilitate the FAIRification of health research data. We also uncovered a wide range of problems and questions that researchers are trying to address by using the different workflows, tools, and infrastructures. Although the concept of FAIR data stewardship in the health research domain is relatively new, almost all continents have been reached by at least one network trying to achieve health data FAIRness. Documented outcomes of FAIRification efforts include peer-reviewed publications, improved data sharing, facilitated data reuse, return on investment, and new treatments. Successful FAIRification of data has informed the management and prognosis of various diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological diseases.

    "We find that improving the interactome modeling increases the number of nodes and interactions, but that isoform and post-translational modification annotation is still limited compared to what can be expected biologically.

In addition, 89.8% (n=335) of respondents indicated that they understood the concept of AI. Of the 4 dimensions analyzed, 'distrust and accountability' obtained a mean score of 3.37 (SD 0.53), 'personal interaction' obtained a mean score of 4.37 (SD 0.60), 'efficiency' obtained a mean score of 3.06 (SD 0.73), and 'being informed' obtained a mean score of 3.67 (SD 0.57). In relation to the 'distrust and accountability' dimension, women, people older than 65 years, the group with university studies, and the population that indicated not understanding the AI concept had significantly more distrust in the use of AI. On the dimension of 'being informed,' it was observed that the group with university studies rated access to information more positively and those who indicated not understanding the concept of AI rated it more negatively.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive explanation of LiteRev\u2019s capabilities, its methodology, and an evaluation of its accuracy and efficiency to a manual LR, highlighting the benefits of using LiteRev. Based on the user\u2019s query, LiteRev performs an automated search on a wide range of open-access databases and retrieves relevant metadata on the resulting papers, including abstracts or full texts when available. These abstracts (or full texts) are text processed and represented as a term frequency-inverse document frequency matrix. Using dimensionality reduction (pairwise controlled manifold approximation) and clustering (hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) techniques, the corpus is divided into different topics described by a list of the most important keywords. The user can then select one or several topics of interest, enter additional keywords to refine its search, or provide key papers to the research question. Based on these inputs, LiteRev performs a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) search and suggests a list of potentially interesting papers. By tagging the relevant ones, the user triggers new k-NN searches until no additional paper is suggested for screening.

    "In this work, we propose a novel multi-omics deep survival prediction approach by dually fused graph convolutional network (GCN) named FGCNSurv. Our FGCNSurv is a complete generative model from multi-omics data to survival outcome of patients, including feature fusion by a factorized bilinear model, graph fusion of multiple graphs, higher-level feature extraction by GCN, and survival prediction by a Cox proportional hazard model. The factorized bilinear model enables to capture cross-omics features and quantify complex relations from multi-omics data.

We analyzed Dutch messages shared between December 2020 and June 2021 on social media and on 2 databases from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), where experiences and questions regarding COVID-19 vaccination are reported. First, natural language processing (NLP) filtering techniques and an initial supervised machine learning model were developed to identify this type of knowledge in a large data set. Subsequently, structural topic modeling was performed to discern thematic patterns related to experiences with COVID-19 vaccination.\n The event summarizes key results or discoveries.\n Similar triggers such as show, demonstrate, observe, find\n Event trigger is <Trigger>\n someone or something discusses something and/with/for another thing in context of some context using some method. It leads to some results, raising some challenge, analyzing some analysis, for purpose of some reason, and considers some ethical consideration, with possible implications like some implication or contradictions like some contradiction.",

    "The study included 664 participants distributed across different pregnancy stages: 269 (40.5%) before 18 gestational weeks, 198 (29.8%) between 24 and 31 weeks, and 197 (29.7%) after delivery. Among them, 49.8% (329/664) favored face-to-face consultations over telehealth clinics, and only 7.3% (48/664) believed the opposite. Additionally, 24.2% (161/664) agreed that telehealth clinics should be launched for obstetric services. However, the overall preference for telehealth clinics was <20% for routine prenatal checkups (81/664, 12.2%) and addressing pregnancy-related concerns, such as vaginal bleeding (76/664, 11.5%), vaginal discharge (128/664, 19.4%), reduced fetal movement (64/664, 9.7%), uterine contractions (62/664, 9.4%), and suspected leakage of amniotic fluid (54/664, 8.2%). Conversely, 76.4% (507/664) preferred telehealth clinics to in-person visits for prenatal education talks, prenatal and postpartum exercise, and addressing breastfeeding problems.

During the postpartum period, compared to before 18 weeks of gestation, significantly more participants agreed that telehealth clinics could be an option for assessing physical symptoms such as vaginal bleeding (aOR 2.105, 95% CI 1.448-3.059), reduced fetal movement (aOR 1.575, 95% CI 1.058-2.345), uterine contractions (aOR 2.906, 95% CI 1.945-4.342), suspected leakage of amniotic fluid (aOR 2.609, 95% CI 1.721-3.954), fever (aOR 1.526, 95% CI 1.109-2.100), and flu-like symptoms (aOR 1.412, 95% CI 1.030-1.936).

    "We analyzed 201 patients who underwent TESE at Tenon Hospital (Assistance Publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris, Sorbonne University, Paris), distributed in a retrospective training cohort of 175 patients (January 2012 to April 2021) and a prospective testing cohort (May 2021 to December 2021) of 26 patients. Preoperative data (according to the French standard exploration of male infertility, 16 variables) including urogenital history, hormonal data, genetic data, and TESE outcomes (representing the target variable) were collected. A TESE was considered positive if we obtained sufficient spermatozoa for intracytoplasmic sperm injection. After preprocessing the raw data, 8 machine learning (ML) models were trained and optimized on the retrospective training cohort data set: The hyperparameter tuning was performed by random search. Finally, the prospective testing cohort data set was used for the model evaluation. The metrics used to evaluate and compare the models were the following: sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), and accuracy.

    "The task of predicting drug-target interactions (DTIs) plays a significant role in facilitating the development of novel drug discovery. Compared with laboratory-based approaches, computational methods proposed for DTI prediction are preferred due to their high-efficiency and low-cost advantages. Recently, much attention has been attracted to apply different graph neural network (GNN) models to discover underlying DTIs from heterogeneous biological information network (HBIN).
