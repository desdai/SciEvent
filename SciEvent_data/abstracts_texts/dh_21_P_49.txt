This article proposes an approach to designing project-based, credit-bearing digital humanities internships, based on experiences engaging students with digital projects affiliated with the Digital Humanities Institute at the University of North Florida. The author reviews recent scholarship on experiential learning and DH pedagogy, and considers why digital humanities internships are valuable for students, faculty, and institutions. The article outlines three general types of DH internships, providing examples for each, and suggesting possible student learning outcomes and a general course structure. The institutional factors necessary to make such experiences possible are also examined.
