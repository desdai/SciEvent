Here, we present an expanded utility of the R package qgg for genetic analyses of complex traits and diseases. One of the major updates of the package is that it now includes Bayesian linear regression modeling procedures, which provide a unified framework for mapping of genetic variants, estimation of heritability, and genomic prediction from either individual level data or from genome-wide association study summary data. With this release, the qgg package now provides a wealth of the commonly used methods in analysis of complex traits and diseases, without the need to switch between software and data formats.
