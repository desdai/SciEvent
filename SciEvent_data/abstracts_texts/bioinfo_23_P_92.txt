Microbiome datasets with taxa linked to the functions (e.g., genes) they encode are becoming more common as metagenomics sequencing approaches improve. However, these data are challenging to analyze due to their complexity. Summary metrics, such as the alpha and beta diversity of taxa contributing to each function (i.e., contributional diversity), represent one approach to investigate these data, but currently there are no straightforward methods for doing so. We addressed this gap by developing FuncDiv, which efficiently performs these computations. Contributional diversity metrics can provide novel insights that would be impossible to identify without jointly considering taxa and functions.
