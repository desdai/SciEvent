The increasing availability of RNA structural information that spans many kilobases of transcript sequence imposes a need for tools that can rapidly screen, identify, and prioritize structural modules of interest. We describe RNA Structural Content Scanner (RSCanner), an automated tool that scans RNA transcripts for regions that contain high levels of secondary structure and then classifies each region for its relative propensity to adopt stable or dynamic structures. RSCanner then generates an intuitive heatmap enabling users to rapidly pinpoint regions likely to contain a high or low density of discrete RNA structures, thereby informing downstream functional or structural investigation.
