We developed the eccDB database to integrate available resources for extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) data. eccDB is a comprehensive repository for storing, browsing, searching, and analyzing eccDNAs from multispecies. The database provides regulatory and epigenetic information on eccDNAs, with a focus on analyzing intrachromosomal and interchromosomal interactions to predict their transcriptional regulatory functions. Moreover, eccDB identifies eccDNAs from unknown DNA sequences and analyzes the functional and evolutionary relationships of eccDNAs among different species. Overall, eccDB offers web-based analytical tools and a comprehensive resource for biologists and clinicians to decipher the molecular regulatory mechanisms of eccDNAs.
