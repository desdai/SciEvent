Sequence alignment is a memory bound computation whose performance in modern systems is limited by the memory bandwidth bottleneck. Processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures alleviate this bottleneck by providing the memory with computing competencies. We propose Alignment-in-Memory (AIM), a framework for high-throughput sequence alignment using PIM, and evaluate it on UPMEM, the first publicly available general-purpose programmable PIM system Our evaluation shows that a real PIM system can substantially outperform server-grade multi-threaded CPU systems running at full-scale when performing sequence alignment for a variety of algorithms, read lengths, and edit distance thresholds. We hope that our findings inspire more work on creating and accelerating bioinformatics algorithms for such real PIM systems.
