Scientists seeking to understand the genomic basis of bacterial phenotypes, such as antibiotic resistance, today have access to an unprecedented number of complete and nearly complete genomes. Making sense of these data requires computational tools able to perform multiple-genome comparisons efficiently, yet currently available tools cannot scale beyond several tens of genomes. We describe PRAWNS, an efficient and scalable tool for multiple-genome analysis. PRAWNS defines a concise set of genomic features (metablocks), as well as pairwise relationships between them, which can be used as a basis for large-scale genotype-phenotype association studies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PRAWNS by identifying genomic regions associated with antibiotic resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii.
