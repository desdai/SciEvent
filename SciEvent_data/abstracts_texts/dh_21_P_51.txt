EuporiaRAGT is one of the pilot projects that adopt the Euporia system as a digital support to a historico-anthropological research on the form and function of rituals in the texts of ancient Greek tragedy. This paper describes the bottom-up approach adopted in the project: during the annotation stage, performed with a Domain-Specific Language designed with a user-centred approach, the domain expert can annotate ritual and religious phenomena, with the possibility of registering different textual and interpretive variants; the design of a search engine, in a second phase of the work, allows the database to be tested and reorganized. Finally, the construction of an ontology allows structuring the tags in order to perform complex queries on the database.
