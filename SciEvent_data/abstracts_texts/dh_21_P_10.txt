The DataScapes Project is an exploration of how Augmented Reality objects can be used as constituents for Landscape Architecture. Using Stephen Ramsay’s Screwmeneutics and Harold Innis' Oral Tradition as our theoretical points of departure, the project integrated the products of Data Art – the visualisation and sonification of data – as the constituents for our two works: The Five Senses and Emergence. The Five Senses was the product of protein data, while Emergence was generated using text from the King James version of the Holy Bible. In this exploratory treatment, we present the methods used to generate and display our two pieces. We further present anecdotal, qualitative evidence of viewer feedback, and use that as a basis to consider the ethics, challenges and opportunities that a future AR Landscape Architecture will present for scholars in the Digital Humanities.
