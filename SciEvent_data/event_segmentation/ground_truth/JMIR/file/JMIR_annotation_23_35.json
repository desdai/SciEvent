    "abstract": "Online medical consultation can serve as a valuable means for rural residents to access high-quality health care resources, thereby mitigating the geographic and economic disadvantages prevalent in rural areas. Nevertheless, due to lower cognitive abilities, rural residents often face challenges in trusting and making effective use of online medical consultations. More likely, adopting a bounded rational decision-making model that facilitates the “offline-to-online” trust transfer could prove to be a potentially effective approach. This strategy aims to encourage less technologically experienced rural residents to trust and make use of online medical consultations. This study aims to characterize the status of “offline-to-online” trust transfer among rural residents in the context of internet health care, and analyze its direct impact on facilitating the utilization of online medical consultation. Additionally, we investigate the family spillover effect of “offline-to-online” trust transfer in promoting the use of online medical consultation among rural family members, considering its distributional effect across various education levels of the population. A multistage stratified random sampling method was used to survey participants in rural areas of China from July to September 2021, encompassing a total of 2597 rural residents from 960 rural households. Propensity score values were estimated using logit regression, and the propensity score matching method, using the K-nearest neighbor matching, radius matching, and kernel matching methods, was applied to create matched treatment and control samples of rural residents based on their experience of “offline-to-online” trust transfer. Subsequently, we calculated average treatment effect scores to compare the differences in utilizing online medical consultation between the treatment and control rural samples. As many as 551/960 (57.4%) rural residents experienced an “offline-to-online” trust transfer, with a higher likelihood observed in the older population with lower levels of education and higher satisfaction with local health care services. Furthermore, rural residents who underwent “offline-to-online” trust transfer were 37%-40% more likely to utilize online medical consultation compared with those who did not experience this trust transfer. Additionally, family members of householders who underwent “offline-to-online” trust transfer were 25%-28% more likely to utilize online medical consultation than those whose householders did not experience this trust transfer. Notably, when compared with populations with high-level education, the “offline-to-online” trust transfer had more significant direct and spillover effects on the utilization of online medical consultation services among rural residents with low-level education. To enhance the “offline-to-online” trust transfer among rural residents and its facilitation in their utilization of online medical consultation, as well as other mobile health (mHealth) and ubiquitous health (uHealth) services, we recommend that online health care providers adopt a “patient-oriented” service model. This approach aims to elevate rural residents’ satisfaction with local health care services and harness the trust-building functions inherent in physician-patient relationships and among family members.",

    "abstract": "As highlighted by the recent World Health Organization Oral Health Resolution, there is an urgent need to better integrate primary and oral health care. Despite evidence and guidelines substantiating the relevance of integrating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and periodontitis care, the fragmentation of primary and oral health care persists. This paper reports on the evaluation of a prototype digital decision support system (DSS) that was developed to enhance the integration of T2DM and periodontitis care. The effects of the prototype DSS were assessed in web-based simulated environments, using 2 different sets of case vignettes in combination with evaluation surveys among 202 general dental practitioners (GDPs) and 206 general practitioners (GPs). Each participant evaluated 3 vignettes, one of which, chosen at random, was assisted by the DSS. Logistic regression analyses were conducted at the participant and case levels. Under DSS assistance, GPs had 8.3 (95% CI 4.32-16.03) times higher odds of recommending a GDP visit. There was no significant impact of DSS assistance on GP advice about common risk factors for T2DM and periodontal disease. GDPs had 4.3 (95% CI 2.08-9.04) times higher odds of recommending a GP visit, 1.6 (95% CI 1.03-2.33) times higher odds of giving advice on disease correlations, and 3.2 (95% CI 1.63-6.35) times higher odds of asking patients about their glycated hemoglobin value. The findings of this study provide a proof of concept for a digital DSS to integrate T2DM and periodontal care. Future updating and testing is warranted to continuously enhance the functionalities of the DSS in terms of interoperability with various types of data sources and diagnostic devices; incorporation of other (oral) health dimensions; application in various settings, including via telemedicine; and further customization of end-user interfaces.",
