    "abstract": "Massively multilingual language models have displayed strong performance in zero-shot (ZS-XLT) and few-shot (FS-XLT) cross-lingual transfer setups, where models fine-tuned on task data in a source language are transferred without any or with only a few annotated instances to the target language(s). However, current work typically overestimates model performance as fine-tuned models are frequently evaluated at model checkpoints that generalize best to validation instances in the target languages. This effectively violates the main assumptions of ‘true’ ZS-XLT and FS-XLT. Such XLT setups require robust methods that do not depend on labeled target language data for validation and model selection. In this work, aiming to improve the robustness of ‘true’ ZS-XLT and FS-XLT, we propose a simple and effective method that averages different checkpoints (i.e., model snapshots) during task fine-tuning. We conduct exhaustive ZS-XLT and FS-XLT experiments across higher-level semantic tasks (NLI, extractive QA) and lower-level token classification tasks (NER, POS). The results indicate that averaging model checkpoints yields systematic and consistent performance gains across diverse target languages in all tasks. Importantly, it simultaneously substantially desensitizes XLT to varying hyperparameter choices in the absence of target language validation. We also show that checkpoint averaging benefits performance when further combined with run averaging (i.e., averaging the parameters of models fine-tuned over independent runs).",

    "[Method]": ": Averaging different checkpoints during task fine-tuning is proposed as a technique to improve the robustness of true ZS-XLT and FS-XLT. Exhaustive ZS-XLT and FS-XLT experiments were conducted using various tasks including NLI, extractive QA, NER, and POS. Run averaging was shown to benefit performance when used alongside checkpoint averaging.",
    "[Results]": ": Averaging model checkpoints yielded systematic and consistent performance gains across diverse target languages in all tested tasks. It significantly reduced sensitivity to hyperparameters by making the XLT less dependent on specific model checkpoints chosen based on target language validation. Combining checkpoint averaging with run averaging provided additional improvements in performance.",
    "[Implications]": ": Improving the robustness of ZS-XLT and FS-XLT through these techniques can lead to more reliable cross-lingual transfer learning systems. These advancements could be applied to enhance real-world natural language processing pipelines requiring high reliability despite limited access to target language annotations. Future work may explore integrating similar strategies into other machine learning domains beyond NLP."

    "abstract": "Emotional support conversation (ESC) aims to provide emotional support (ES) to improve one’s mental state. Existing works stay at fitting grounded responses and responding strategies (e.g., question), which ignore the effect on ES and lack explicit goals to guide emotional positive transition. To this end, we introduce a new paradigm to formalize multi-turn ESC as a process of positive emotion elicitation. Addressing this task requires finely adjusting the elicitation intensity in ES as the conversation progresses while maintaining conversational goals like coherence. In this paper, we propose Supporter, a mixture-of-expert-based reinforcement learning model, and well design ES and dialogue coherence rewards to guide policy’s learning for responding. Experiments verify the superiority of Supporter in achieving positive emotion elicitation during responding while maintaining conversational goals including coherence.",
