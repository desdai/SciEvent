    "abstract": "Survival analysis is an important tool for modeling time-to-event data, e.g., to predict the survival time of a patient after a cancer diagnosis or a certain treatment. While deep neural networks work well in standard prediction tasks, it is still unclear how to best utilize these deep models in survival analysis due to the difficulty of modeling right censored data, especially for multi-omics data. Although existing methods have shown the advantage of multi-omics integration in survival prediction, it remains challenging to extract complementary information from different omics and improve the prediction accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel multi-omics deep survival prediction approach by dually fused graph convolutional network (GCN) named FGCNSurv. Our FGCNSurv is a complete generative model from multi-omics data to survival outcome of patients, including feature fusion by a factorized bilinear model, graph fusion of multiple graphs, higher-level feature extraction by GCN, and survival prediction by a Cox proportional hazard model. The factorized bilinear model enables to capture cross-omics features and quantify complex relations from multi-omics data. By fusing single-omics features and the cross-omics features, and simultaneously fusing multiple graphs from different omics, GCN with the generated dually fused graph could capture higher-level features for computing the survival loss in the Cox-PH model. Comprehensive experimental results on real-world datasets with gene expression and microRNA expression data show that the proposed FGCNSurv method outperforms existing survival prediction methods, and imply its ability to extract complementary information for survival prediction from multi-omics data.",
    "[Background]": "Survival analysis is an important tool for modeling time-to-event data, such as predicting the survival time of a patient after a cancer diagnosis or a certain treatment. While deep neural networks excel in standard prediction tasks, their application in survival analysis remains challenging due to the complexity of handling right-censored data, particularly when dealing with multi-omics data. Existing methods have demonstrated the benefits of integrating multi-omics data for survival prediction; however, extracting complementary information from various omics to enhance prediction accuracy remains a significant challenge.",
    "[Method]": "We introduce a novel multi-omics deep survival prediction framework known as Factorized Graph Convolutional Network for Survival Analysis (FGCNSurv). This model encompasses several key components: first, a factorized bilinear model that facilitates capturing cross-omics features and quantifying intricate relationships within multi-omics data. Second, it incorporates feature fusion through both single-omics attributes and cross-omics-derived features. Additionally, our framework employs multiple graph structures derived from distinct omics domains, which are then fused together using a graph convolutional network (GCN). Finally, the model extracts high-dimensional features via the GCN before employing a Cox proportional hazards model to predict survival outcomes.",
    "[Results]": "Through comprehensive experimentation utilizing real-world datasets comprising gene expression and microRNA expression profiles, our proposed FGCNSurv method consistently outperformed existing survival prediction techniques. These empirical results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in leveraging multi-omics data to achieve superior predictive accuracy, highlighting its capability to extract complementary information essential for accurate survival predictions across diverse biological contexts.",
    "[Implications]": "The success of FGCNSurv suggests potential broader applications in clinical settings where precise survival prediction is crucial, such as personalized medicine and disease prognosis. Furthermore, this methodology may serve as a foundation for developing advanced analytical tools capable of integrating additional omic layers, thereby enhancing predictive capabilities in complex biological systems."
