    "abstract": "This article sheds light on the methods and meaning of W. E. B. Du Bois’ 1899 study of the everyday lives of Black residents of Philadelphia’s Seventh Ward. It does so by juxtaposing the way Du Bois conducted his research with our contemporary efforts to recover, recreate, and preserve The Philadelphia Negro using digital and geospatial technologies to document historical and contemporary patterns relating to race and class. Beginning with an exploration of primary source documents that provide new details about how Du Bois went about his original research, we focus on the humanities and social science research methods that he employed. Of note is the color-coded parcel-level map Du Bois created to illustrate Black social class status, which reflected both the influence of the Social Survey Movement and Du Bois’ efforts to present a new understanding of the color line. His findings were groundbreaking, considering that most white scientists of his time assumed Black people to be biologically inferior and socially homogeneous. Instead, he documented the variability and social stratification within Philadelphia’s Black population and the systematic exclusion they faced because of anti-Black racism. Our ongoing project — The WARD: Race and Class in Du Bois’ Seventh Ward, which seeks to recreate Du Bois’ study — includes new technologies and participatory research methods that engage high school and college students. In-depth, intergenerational oral histories conducted with students also add a new dimension to this work and complement our high school curriculum, which incorporates online mapping, documentaries, a board game, a walking tour, and a mural to engage others to create their own primary sources. This research provides a historical context for today’s racial tensions as we seek new ways to address the 21st century color line.",

    "abstract": "This article examines how Black fans utilize social media platforms to engage fandoms of contemporary Black popular cultural productions. Specifically, how Black digital intimacies are created through examining the interiority expressed in the cultural productions and their fandoms. Utilizing YouTube and Twitter fan comments from The Mis-Adventures of Awkward Black Girl [YouTube, 2011-2012] and Insecure [HBO, 2016-2021], this article proposes affirmative transformative fandom to examine the affective relationships fans have with their fan objects and fellow fans to explore their own intimate lives.",

    "[Method]": "The study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis of social media data with qualitative interpretation of fan comments and cultural texts. Data were collected from YouTube videos and related forums, along with Twitter interactions surrounding both series. The framework used is based on theories of affect theory and transformative criticism, which emphasize the role of emotions and reinterpretation in audience engagement.",
    "[Results]": "Key findings include evidence of strong emotional bonds formed via shared viewing experiences and online discussions. Fans often express identification with characters and narratives, leading to rich interpretative communities. Additionally, there’s significant participation in creating and disseminating fan content, such as memes and fan fiction, which further fosters connectivity among fans.",
    "[Implications]": "These findings highlight the importance of considering digital spaces as sites for fostering community and identity formation among marginalized groups. They also suggest potential applications in media production and marketing strategies aimed at deeper audience engagement. Future studies could expand on the long-term impacts of such digital practices on individuals' real-world relationships and societal norms."
