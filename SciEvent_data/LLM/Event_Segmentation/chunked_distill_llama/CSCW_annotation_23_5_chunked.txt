    "abstract": "Accessibility efforts, how we can make the world usable and useful to as many people as possible, have focused on how we can support and allow for the autonomy and independence of people with disabilities, neurodivergencies, chronic conditions, and older adults. Despite these efforts, not all technology is designed or implemented to support everyone's needs. TikTok. Recently, a community-organized push by creators and general users of TikTok urged the platform to add accessibility features, such as closed captioning, to allow more people to use the platform with greater ease. Through an interview study exploring the experiences of creatives on TikTok, we explore the creative practices of people with ADHD and those who experience similar challenges, focusing on the kinds of accessibility they create through their creative work. We find that creatives engage in critical infrastructuring–a process of bottom-up (re)design–to make the platform more accessible despite the challenges the platform presents to them as creators through creating and augmenting video editing and video captioning infrastructures. We then reflect on how the introduction of a top-down infrastructure - the implementation of an auto-captioning feature - shifts the critical infrastructure practices of TikTok creatives. Through their infrastructuring, creatives were revising the broader sociotechnical capabilities of TikTok to support their own needs as well as the broader needs of the TikTok community. We discuss how the routine of infrastructuring accessibility is a form of incidental care work and highlight how accessibility is an evolving sociotechnical construct, forwarding the concept of contextual accessibility.",
    "[Background]": ": Accessibility efforts aim to make the world usable and useful for as many people as possible, particularly supporting individuals with disabilities, neurodivergences, chronic conditions, and older adults. However, not all technology is designed or implemented to meet everyone's needs. TikTok recently faced a community-organized push urging the platform to add accessibility features like closed captioning to enhance usability for more people. An interview study explored the experiences of creatives on TikTok, focusing on how people with ADHD and others with similar challenges approach their creative work to ensure it meets accessibility standards. These creatives engaged in critical infrastructuring—a grassroots redesign—to adapt TikTok into a more accessible platform, particularly through enhancing video editing and captioning tools. The introduction of TikTok’s auto-captions shifted this dynamic, altering the ways creatives approached making the platform accessible. Their infrastructuring efforts expanded beyond personal needs to benefit the broader TikTok community. This routine of adding accessibility features can be seen as incidental care work, highlighting that accessibility is an evolving sociotechnical concept shaped within specific contexts.",

    "abstract": "Current cultural policies are evolving from social inclusion (removing barriers and promoting equality for participation in culture) to social cohesion (fostering solid bonds between groups despite their differences). Digital interventions can create spaces that promote social inclusion and cohesion. In this paper, we report on the design and evaluation of a cultural heritage and digital storytelling application supporting a participatory approach to culture and hosting society. We evaluate our intervention in three marginalized communities with different social-cultural contexts: migrant women in Barcelona, a community living in a priority neighbourhood in Paris, and second and third-generation migrants in Lisbon. Through an analysis of their application use, our findings point at their needs and desires, highlighting how the app can support social inclusion as the first step towards cohesion, but that these are heterogeneous concepts susceptible to nuanced appropriations by the different communities.",
