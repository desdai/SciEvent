    "abstract": "Thorough data stewardship is a key enabler of comprehensive health research. Processes such as data collection, storage, access, sharing, and analytics require researchers to follow elaborate data management strategies properly and consistently. Studies have shown that findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data leads to improved data sharing in different scientific domains. This scoping review identifies and discusses concepts, approaches, implementation experiences, and lessons learned in FAIR initiatives in health research data. The Arksey and O’Malley stage-based methodological framework for scoping reviews was applied. PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched to access relevant publications. Articles written in English, published between 2014 and 2020, and addressing FAIR concepts or practices in the health domain were included. The 3 data sources were deduplicated using a reference management software. In total, 2 independent authors reviewed the eligibility of each article based on defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. A charting tool was used to extract information from the full-text papers. The results were reported using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. A total of 2.18% (34/1561) of the screened articles were included in the final review. The authors reported FAIRification approaches, which include interpolation, inclusion of comprehensive data dictionaries, repository design, semantic interoperability, ontologies, data quality, linked data, and requirement gathering for FAIRification tools. Challenges and mitigation strategies associated with FAIRification, such as high setup costs, data politics, technical and administrative issues, privacy concerns, and difficulties encountered in sharing health data despite its sensitive nature were also reported. We found various workflows, tools, and infrastructures designed by different groups worldwide to facilitate the FAIRification of health research data. We also uncovered a wide range of problems and questions that researchers are trying to address by using the different workflows, tools, and infrastructures. Although the concept of FAIR data stewardship in the health research domain is relatively new, almost all continents have been reached by at least one network trying to achieve health data FAIRness. Documented outcomes of FAIRification efforts include peer-reviewed publications, improved data sharing, facilitated data reuse, return on investment, and new treatments. Successful FAIRification of data has informed the management and prognosis of various diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological diseases. Efforts to FAIRify data on a wider variety of diseases have been ongoing since the COVID-19 pandemic. This work summarises projects, tools, and workflows for the FAIRification of health research data. The comprehensive review shows that implementing the FAIR concept in health data stewardship carries the promise of improved research data management and transparency in the era of big data and open research publishing.",

    "abstract": "Digital interventions for health financing, if implemented at scale, have the potential to improve health system performance by reducing transaction costs and improving data-driven decision-making. However, many interventions never reach sustainability, and evidence on success factors for scale is scarce. The Insurance Management Information System (IMIS) is a digital intervention for health financing, designed to manage an insurance scheme and already implemented on a national scale in Tanzania. A previous study found that the IMIS claim function was poorly adopted by health care workers (HCWs), questioning its potential to enable strategic purchasing and succeed at scale. This study aimed to understand why the adoption of the IMIS claim function by HCWs remained low in Tanzania and to assess implications for use at scale. We conducted 21 semistructured interviews with HCWs and management staff in 4 districts where IMIS was first implemented. We sampled respondents by using a maximum variation strategy. We used the framework method for data analysis, applying a combination of inductive and deductive coding to organize codes in a socioecological model. Finally, we related emerging themes to a framework for digital health interventions for scale. Respondents appreciated IMIS’s intrinsic software characteristics and technical factors and acknowledged IMIS as a valuable tool to simplify claim management. Human factors, extrinsic ecosystem, and health care ecosystem were considered as barriers to widespread adoption. Digital interventions for health financing, such as IMIS, may have the potential for scale if careful consideration is given to the environment in which they are placed. Without a sustainable health financing environment, sufficient infrastructure, and human capacity, they cannot unfold their full potential to improve health financing functions and ultimately contribute to universal health coverage.",
    "[Background]": ": Digital interventions for health financing, if implemented at scale, have the potential to improve health system performance by reducing transaction costs and enhancing data-driven decision-making. However, many interventions fail to achieve sustainability, and there is limited evidence on successful factors for scaling up. The Insurance Management Information System (IMIS) is a digital intervention specifically designed to manage health insurance schemes and has been rolled out nationally in Tanzania. Prior studies have highlighted that the IMIS claim function faced poor adoption among healthcare workers (HCWs), casting doubt on its ability to facilitate strategic purchasing and sustainably operate at scale. This study aims to explore why the adoption of the IMIS claim function remains low among HCWs in Tanzania and evaluate the implications for broader implementation efforts. Researchers conducted 21 semi-structured interviews with HCWs and managerial staff across four districts where IMIS had initially been introduced. Participants were selected using a maximum variation sampling approach to ensure diversity in experiences and perspectives. Data analysis employed the framework method, combining both inductive and deductive coding to organize concepts within a socioecological model. Findings were then contextualized through a theoretical lens focused on digital health interventions intended for large-scale application. Interviewees recognized the inherent strengths of the IMIS software, including its technical capabilities and user-friendly design, while acknowledging its value in simplifying claims processing. Despite these positive attributes, several challenges were identified as barriers to more widespread adoption, including human limitations, external environmental factors, and complexities within the healthcare ecosystem. These insights suggest that digital health financing tools like IMIS hold promise for scalability but require careful attention to the surrounding environment, including robust health financing mechanisms, adequate infrastructure, and sufficient human resources. Without addressing these foundational elements, the full potential of such interventions to enhance health financing operations—and thereby advance universal health coverage—cannot be realized.",
