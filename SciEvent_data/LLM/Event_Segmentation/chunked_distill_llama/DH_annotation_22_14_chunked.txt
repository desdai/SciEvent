    "abstract": "Network representation is a crucial topic in historical social network analysis. The debate around their value and connotations, led by humanist scholars, is today more relevant than ever, seeing how common these representations are as support for historical analysis. Force-directed networks, in particular, are popular as they can be developed relatively quickly, and reveal patterns and structures in data. The underlying algorithms, although powerful in revealing hidden patterns, do not retain meaningful structure and existing hierarchies within historical social networks. In this article, we question the foreign aspect of this structure that force-directed layouts create in historical datasets. We explore the importance of hierarchy in social networks, and investigate whether hierarchies - strongly present within our models of social structure - affect our perception of social network data. Results from our user evaluation indicate that hierarchical network representations reduce cognitive load and lead to more frequent and deeper insights into historical social networks. We also find that users report a preference for the hierarchical graph representation. We analyse these findings in light of the broader discussion on the value of force-directed network representations within humanistic research, and introduce open questions for future work in this line of research.",

The debate around their value and connotations, led by humanist scholars, is today more relevant than ever, seeing how common these representations are as support for historical analysis. Force-directed networks, in particular, are popular as they can be developed relatively quickly, and reveal patterns and structures in data.",
    "[Method]": "Although force-directed networks are powerful tools for uncovering hidden patterns, they fail to retain meaningful structure and existing hierarchies within historical social networks. This study explores the importance of hierarchy in social networks and investigates whether hierarchies, which are strongly present within our models of social structure, influence our perception of social network data.",
    "[Results]": "User evaluations indicate that hierarchical network representations significantly reduce cognitive load and foster deeper insights into historical social networks. Additionally, participants prefer hierarchical graph representations over other formats.",
    "[Implications]": "These findings suggest that hierarchical representations may offer valuable alternatives to traditional force-directed network visualizations in humanistic research. Future studies should address how different visualization approaches might best serve specific analytical needs in historical contexts."
