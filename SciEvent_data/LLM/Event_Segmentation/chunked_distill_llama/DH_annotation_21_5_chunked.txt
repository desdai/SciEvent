    "abstract": "Current theories about the significance of annotations in literary studies are based primarily on assumptions developed in print culture about verbal texts. In these textual theories, the text is typically present, authorized, and centralized as the ideal text for an ideal reader, and to annotate is to add authorized comments in a sociotechnical system that includes publication, dissemination, and reception. To audiate is to imagine a song that's not playing. In music learning theory, audiation is based on the concept that the musician learns to play music by developing their own musical aptitude, her individual interpretation of a musical score based on her particular experience of the music. This short article introduces audiation as an alternate theoretical framing for articulating the significance of personal literary annotations. Comparing commentary on psalms in the Middle Ages to IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) web annotations, we use the concept of audiation to situate annotations within literary study in terms of a more capacious understanding of the individual's interpretation of text and of the reading experience as part of an unauthorized, distributed, and decentralized system. By bringing together theories and technologies of annotation with sound, we offer the concept of audiated annotations as a means to re-evaluate modes of access, discovery, and analysis of cultural objects in digital sound studies.",

    "abstract": "This article describes the creation of a database of over 1 million images of eighteenth-century printers’ ornaments (or fleurons) using computer vision, and how the database was refined using machine learning. The successes and limitations of the method used are discussed, and the purpose of the database for research in the humanities is outlined. The article concludes with a summary of recent developments in the project, which include the addition of a visual search function provided by the Seebibyte Project.",

    "[Method]": "The article discusses the creation of a large-scale database containing over 1 million images of eighteenth-century printers' ornaments, also known as fleurons. This initiative utilized advanced technologies like computer vision and machine learning to develop and refine this resource.",
    "[Results]": "The study highlights both the achievements and limitations encountered during the development process, providing insights into the methodologies employed.",
    "[Implications]": "The primary goal of the database is to support scholarly research in the field of humanities, offering valuable tools for studying historical printing practices. Recent advancements in the project have introduced a new feature—a visual search function—made possible through collaboration with the Seebibyte Project, enhancing the utility of the database for users seeking specialized resources."
