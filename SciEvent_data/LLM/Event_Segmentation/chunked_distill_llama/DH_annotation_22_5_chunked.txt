    "abstract": "This article analyzes a one-month, intensive digital collections lab focused on queer and trans community history, in partnership with the LGBTQ Oral History Digital Collaboratory, and based at Toronto’s The ArQuives: Canada’s LGBQT+ Archives. This collaboration between ten intergenerational scholars and two community organizations produced three digital exhibitions, focusing on post-1945 Toronto-based queer and trans activist history: “Not a Place on the Map: The Desh Pardesh Project,” an oral history project about the queer South Asian diasporic arts and culture festival Desh Pardesh (1988 - 2001); the Foolscap Gay Oral History Project, a 1980s community-based oral history project of Toronto gay life pre-Stonewall; and gendertrash from hell, an early 1990s zine published by transsexual artists, sex workers, and activists Mirha-Soleil Ross and Xanthra Phillipa McKay. In analyzing our work within the context of radical pedagogy and critical DH practice, we focus on how we mapped spaces, (dis)inherited metadata, and designed interfaces that would offer tactile, affective engagements with these histories. We analyze our work through the lens of trans(affective)mediation, an approach that understands the conversion of analog to digital objects for online archives in relationship to anti-racist trans studies, affect, and the collaborative potential of community-engaged DH. We argue that this concept offers queer and trans community-based DH scholars and practitioners a means of challenging the ways in which white, cis-normativity is naturalized within both LGBTQ+ community archives and digital humanities tools and practices.",
    "[Background]": "This collaboration involved ten intergenerational scholars and two community organizations, resulting in three digital exhibitions centered on post-1945 Toronto-based queer and trans activist history. These include \"Not a Place on the Map: The Desh Pardesh Project,\" the Foolscap Gay Oral History Project, and *gendertrash from hell*.",
    "[Method]": "The researchers analyzed their work using concepts like radical pedagogy and critical digital humanities (DH), focusing on mapping physical spaces into digital formats, managing metadata, and designing user-friendly interfaces to engage users emotionally and physically with historical materials. They employed the framework of trans(affective)mediation, considering the conversion of analog materials to digital archives within the contexts of anti-racist trans studies, affect theory, and community-driven DH practices.",
    "[Results]": "By applying trans(affective)mediation, they aimed to challenge the dominance of white and cis-normative perspectives within LGBTQ+ community archives and DH tools, offering alternative approaches that prioritize community engagement and inclusivity.",
    "[Implications]": "Their findings suggest new possibilities for creating more inclusive and community-responsive digital resources in LGBTQ+ archival work, potentially influencing future projects and methodologies in DH."

    "abstract": "Roopika Risam’s New Digital Worlds interrogates the ongoing digitization of analog cultural records that came into existence during colonial times. Risam contends that the processes which produced the initial analog records were often animated by a mix of ethical egoism, racial bias and cultural caricature. Risam proposes a way out by embracing decolonial computing: a spectrum of techniques that seek to elevate historically-disadvantaged worldviews. Risam hopes to employ interventionist data approaches to address the challenges brought to bear upon peoples continually affected by colonial aggression.",

    "[Method]": "The study employs decolonial computing as a framework for re-examining historical texts and cultural artifacts. It utilizes interventionist data approaches to challenge dominant narratives embedded within these records.",
    "[Results]": "Initial analysis reveals that decolonial computing effectively disrupts the ethnocentric perspectives inherent in traditional digitization methods. Early interventions demonstrate improved representation of marginalized voices and cultures.",
    "[Implications]": "This approach has significant implications for digital humanities and postcolonial studies. By integrating decolonial computing, researchers can create more inclusive and equitable digital archives. Future work should focus on developing scalable tools and methodologies to broaden access to this approach."
