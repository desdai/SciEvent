    "abstract": "Despite the recent progress in language generation models, their outputs may not always meet user expectations. In this work, we study whether informational feedback in natural language can be leveraged to improve generation quality and user preference alignment. To this end, we consider factual consistency in summarization, the quality that the summary should only contain information supported by the input documents, as the user-expected preference. We collect a high-quality dataset, DeFacto, containing human demonstrations and informational natural language feedback consisting of corrective instructions, edited summaries, and explanations with respect to the factual consistency of the summary. Using our dataset, we study three natural language generation tasks: (1) editing a summary by following the human feedback, (2) generating human feedback for editing the original summary, and (3) revising the initial summary to correct factual errors by generating both the human feedback and edited summary. We show that DeFacto can provide factually consistent human-edited summaries and further insights into summarization factual consistency thanks to its informational natural language feedback. We further demonstrate that fine-tuned language models can leverage our dataset to improve the summary factual consistency, while large language models lack the zero-shot learning ability in our proposed tasks that require controllable text generation.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art techniques common to low resource Machine Translation (MT) are applied to improve MT of spoken language text to Sign Language (SL) glosses. In our experiments, we improve the performance of the transformer-based models via (1) data augmentation, (2) semi-supervised Neural Machine Translation (NMT), (3) transfer learning and (4) multilingual NMT. The proposed methods are implemented progressively on two German SL corpora containing gloss annotations. Multilingual NMT combined with data augmentation appear to be the most successful setting, yielding statistically significant improvements as measured by three automatic metrics (up to over 6 points BLEU), and confirmed via human evaluation. Our best setting outperforms all previous work that report on the same test-set and is also confirmed on a corpus of the American Sign Language (ASL).",
