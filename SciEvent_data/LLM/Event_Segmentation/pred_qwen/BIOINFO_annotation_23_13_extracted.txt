[Background]: <NONE>

[Method]: We demonstrate the advantage of the proposed methods through simulations and an application to the study of the effect on pancreatic cancer risk by the polygenic risk score defined by BMI-associated genetic markers.

[Results]: <NONE>

[Implications]: <NONE>


Paper Code: bioinfo_23_P_352

[Background]: <NONE>

[Method]: We describe a compression scheme for BUS files and an implementation of the algorithm in the BUStools software.

[Results]: This amounts to an 8.3x reduction in the file size, resulting in a compressed size of 122GB for the dataset.

[Implications]: <NONE>
