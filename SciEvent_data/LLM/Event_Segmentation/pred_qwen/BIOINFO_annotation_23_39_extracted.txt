[Background]: Pairwise sequence alignment is a very time-consuming step in common bioinformatics pipelines. Speeding up this step requires heuristics, efficient implementations, and/or hardware acceleration. A promising candidate for all of the above is the recently proposed GenASM algorithm.

[Method]: We identify and address three inefficiencies in the GenASM algorithm: it has a high amount of data movement, a large memory footprint, and does some unnecessary work. We propose Scrooge, a fast and memory-frugal genomic sequence aligner. Scrooge includes three novel algorithmic improvements which reduce the data movement, memory footprint, and the number of operations in the GenASM algorithm. We provide efficient open-source implementations of the Scrooge algorithm for CPUs and GPUs, which demonstrate the significant benefits of our algorithmic improvements.

[Results]: For long reads, the CPU version of Scrooge achieves a 20.1×, 1.7×, and 2.1× speedup over KSW2, Edlib, and a CPU implementation of GenASM, respectively. The GPU version of Scrooge achieves a 4.0×, 80.4×, 6.8×, 12.6×, and 5.9× speedup over the CPU version of Scrooge, KSW2, Edlib, Darwin-GPU, and a GPU implementation of GenASM, respectively. We estimate an ASIC implementation of Scrooge to use 3.6× less chip area and 2.1× less power than a GenASM ASIC while maintaining the same throughput.

[Background]: Peptides are ubiquitous throughout life and involved in a wide range of biological processes, ranging from neural signaling in higher organisms to antimicrobial peptides in bacteria.

[Method]: Many peptides are generated post-translationally by cleavage of precursor proteins and can thus not be detected directly from genomics data, as the specificities of the responsible proteases are often not completely understood. We present DeepPeptide, a deep learning model that predicts cleaved peptides directly from the amino acid sequence.

[Results]: DeepPeptide shows both improved precision and recall for peptide detection compared to previous methodology. We show that the model is capable of identifying peptides in underannotated proteomes.

[Implications]: <NONE>
