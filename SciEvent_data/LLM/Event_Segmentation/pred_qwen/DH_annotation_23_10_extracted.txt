[Background]: This paper describes a collaborative project designed to meet the needs of communities interested in Gə'əz language texts - and other under-resourced manuscript traditions - by developing an easy-to-use open-source tool that converts images of manuscript pages into a transcription using optical character recognition (OCR).

[Method]: Our computational tool incorporates a custom data curation process to address the language-specific facets of Gə'əz coupled with a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network to perform the transcription.

[Results]: An open-source OCR transcription tool for digitized Gə'əz manuscripts can be used by students and scholars of Ethiopian manuscripts to create a substantial and computer-searchable corpus of transcribed and digitized Gə'əz texts, opening access to vital resources for sustaining the history and living culture of Ethiopia and its people.

[Implications]: <NONE>


Paper Code: dh_23_P_50

[Background]: The article sets up a critique of Sentiment Analysis (SA) tools in literary studies, both from a theoretical and a computational point of view.

[Method]: In the first section, a possible use of SA in narratology and reader response studies is discussed, highlighting the gaps between literary theories and computational models, and suggesting possible solutions to fill them.

[Results]: In the second section, a stratified taxonomy of SA tools is proposed, which distinguishes: (1) the emotion theory adopted by the tool; (2) the method used to build the emotion resources; (3) the technique adopted to accomplish the analysis.

[Implications]: <NONE>
