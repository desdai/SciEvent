[Background]: Families strengthen bonds by collectively constructing social identity through sharing stories, language, and culture. For immigrant families, language and culture barriers disrupt the mechanisms for maintaining intergenerational connection. Immigrant grandparents and grandchildren are particularly at risk of disconnect.

[Method]: In this paper, we investigate existing design guidelines using a tool (StoryTapestry) to explore the storytelling and crafting process of South-Asian immigrant grandparents and grandchildren. Pairs used culturally-relevant images to create digital visual artifacts that tell their stories. Grandparent-grandchild pairs from 10 South-Asian immigrant families participated in this exploration of how the digital process fosters positive social connection, culture sharing, and co-construction.

[Results]: A thematic analysis revealed how collaborative digital crafting encourages the crossing of language and culture barriers, knowledge sharing, and creativity.

[Background]: Benefits of learning by teaching (LbT) have been highlighted by previous studies from a pedagogical lens, as well as through computer-supported systems. However, the challenges that university students face in technology-mediated LbT—whether it be teaching oneself, teaching a peer, or teaching an agent—are not well understood. Furthermore, there is a gap in knowledge on the challenges that students encounter throughout the process of teaching (content selection, preparation, teaching, receiving and giving feedback, and reflection) despite its importance to the design of LbT platforms.

[Method]: We conducted a study with 24 university students where they taught content they had not fully grasped, without guidance, and participated in a semi-structured interview.

[Results]: Results demonstrate that participants encountered the following challenges: psychological barriers relating to self and others, and lack of know-how.

[Implications]: <NONE>
