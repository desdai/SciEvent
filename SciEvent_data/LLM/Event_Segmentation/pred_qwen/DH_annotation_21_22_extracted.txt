[Background]: In this paper, we attack the problem of parsing name expressions and inferring standard name form, gender and nobility status from serial historical sources. This is a small but important part of modelling historians' analysis of such sources, as they extract a lot of information from the names in text, and this information constrains their search. The task of parsing proper names seems to be easy, but it is a hard problem even for the modern languages, and even more challenging for the languages of historical sources.

[Method]: The test case used for the research was from the middle 19th century census for the old town centre of Zagreb. In order to evaluate and compare the fitness of the probabilistic and rule-based models for the task of inferring standard name forms, both conditional random field (CRF) and rule-based models based on stable model semantics (Answer Set Programming Rules) were developed.

[Results]: Our results indicated that the rule-based approach is more suitable for inferring standard name forms from historical texts than the more widespread statistical approach.

[Implications]: <NONE>

[Background]: In this paper, we present MINERVA, the first benchmark dataset for the detection of musical instruments in non-photorealistic, unrestricted image collections from the realm of the visual arts. This effort is situated against the scholarly background of music iconography, an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of musicology and art history.

[Method]: [Results]: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the task but also highlight the significant challenges which this artistic material poses to computer vision. We evaluate the system to an out-of-sample collection and offer an interpretive discussion of the false positives detected. The error analysis yields a number of unexpected insights into the contextual cues that trigger the detector.
