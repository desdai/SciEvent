[Background]: Mass signal annotation remains a significant challenge for untargeted mass spectrometry analysis of complex mixtures. Molecular networks are becoming more widely utilized within the mass spectrometry field as tools for annotating large-scale experiments. A previous study demonstrated that automatic propagation of annotations via Network Annotation Propagation (NAP) could leverage spectral library matches on these networks. However, this method had a limitation where it only propagated information locally, specifically to the immediate neighbors of matched spectra.

[Method]: To address this limitation, our current work introduces an expansion of annotation propagation beyond direct connections utilizing random walks on graphs, encapsulated in the ChemWalker Python library. The methodology leverages combinatorial in silico fragmentations conducted by MetFrag, which searches biological relevance databases. Instead of relying solely on spectral network connectivity combined with structural similarities between potential candidates, we employed the MetFusion scoring function to generate weights for creating a weighted graph. Subsequently, this graph served as input into the random walk algorithm designed to compute probabilities associated with traversing sets of candidates originating from initial seeds represented by spectral library matches.

[Results]: Relative to its predecessor, NAP, ChemWalker exhibits enhancements including improved runtime efficiency, greater scalability, and better maintenance capabilities. These advancements make ChemWalker suitable for broader application scenarios.

[Background]: With recent advances in sequencing technologies, it is now possible to obtain near-perfect complete bacterial chromosome assemblies cheaply and efficiently by combining a long-read-first assembly approach with short-read polishing.

[Method]: Plassembler was developed to provide a tool that automatically assembles and outputs bacterial plasmids using a hybrid assembly approach. It achieves increased accuracy and computational efficiency compared to the existing gold standard tool Unicycler by removing chromosomal reads from the input read sets using a mapping approach.
