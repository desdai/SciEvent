Paper Code: ACL_23_P_866

[Background]: This paper presents a comprehensive study aimed at expanding the understanding of CR in NMT.

[Method]: For the evaluation, we propose a novel entity-aware evaluation method that takes into account both the NMT candidate and important entities in the candidate, which is more aligned with human judgement.

[Results]: <NONE>

[Implications]: Based on the strong testbed and evaluation methods, we identify challenges in training NMT models with high CR abilities and suggest directions for further unlabeled data utilization and model design.


Paper Code: ACL_23_P_377

[Background]: A series of datasets and models have been proposed for summaries generated for well-formatted documents such as news articles.

[Method]: Dialogue summaries, however, have been under explored. In this paper, we present the first dataset with fine-grained factual error annotations named DIASUMFACT. We define fine-grained factual error detection as a sentence-level multi-label classification problem, and we evaluate two state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on our dataset. Both models yield sub-optimal results, with a macro-averaged F1 score of around 0.25 over 6 error classes. We further propose an unsupervised model ENDERANKER via candidate ranking using pretrained encoder-decoder models.

[Results]: Our model performs on par with the SOTA models while requiring fewer resources. These observations confirm the challenges in detecting factual errors from dialogue summaries, which call for further studies, for which our dataset and results offer a solid foundation.

[Implications]: <NONE>
