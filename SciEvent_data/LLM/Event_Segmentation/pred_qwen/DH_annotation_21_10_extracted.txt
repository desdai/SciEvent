[Background]: In this article, I outline a method of combining ethnography and computational soundscape analysis in order to listen to processes of gentrification in Washington, DC.

[Method]: I utilize Kaleidoscope Pro, a software suite built to visualize and cluster bioacoustic recordings (typically birds and bats) to cluster points of tension in the soundscape of Shaw, a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood in DC.

[Results]: Clustering and visualizing these sounds (which include car horns, sirens, public transportation, and music) makes audible the sonic markers of gentrification in Shaw.

[Implications]: <NONE>

[Background]: Studying collaboration in music is a prominent area of research in fields such as cultural studies, history, and musicology. A challenge is that heterogeneous data makes it difficult to study collaboration networks across music genres, which means that there are almost only studies on individual genres.

[Method]: Techniques, experimental setups, frameworks, datasets.

[Results]: To illustrate the approach, we provide a comparison of the genres Jazz and Hip Hop.

[Implications]: <NONE>
