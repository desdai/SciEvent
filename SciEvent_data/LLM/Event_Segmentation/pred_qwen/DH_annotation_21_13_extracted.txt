Paper Code: dh_21_P_34

[Background]: Over the past decade, podcasting has grown into one of the most important media forms in the world. This article argues that podcasting's unique technical affordances — particularly RSS feeds and user-entered metadata — open up productive methods for exploring the cultural practices and meanings of the medium.

[Method]: We share three different methods for studying RSS feeds and podcast metadata: 1) visualizing how topics and keywords trend over time; 2) visualizing networks of commonly associated keywords entered by podcasters; and 3) analyzing norms and common practices for the duration of podcasts (as a time-based media format, podcasting is unusual in that it is not bound by the programming schedules and technical limitations that provide strict parameters for most audiovisual forms).

[Results]: The methods and preliminary results reveal how metadata can function as a surrogate for studying large collections of time-based media objects.

[Implications]: <NONE>

[Background]: This paper introduces Coleto, an automatic collation tool for the comparison of variant texts in English, German, or French

[Method]: which separates edits from variant texts so that textual changes can be classified and contextualized. Coleto’s proposed methodology for the classification of edits in variants includes:

[Results]: major/minor expansion, major/minor condensation, changes to numbers and whitespace, and common orthographic features. From this classification schema, Coleto generates:

[Implications]: <NONE>
