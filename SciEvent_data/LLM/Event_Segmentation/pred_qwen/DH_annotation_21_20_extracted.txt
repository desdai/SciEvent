[Background]: This paper introduces and unpacks several challenges faced by stewards who work with audiovisual resources, departing from the premise that audiovisual resources are undervalued and underutilized as primary source materials for scholarship and therefore receive less attention in the sphere of digital humanities.

[Method]: It will then present original research from the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH), in conjunction with the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Wisconsin Historical Society, on a project entitled Unlocking the Airwaves: Revitalizing an Early Public Radio Collection.

[Results]: As a case study, Unlocking the Airwaves successfully meets these challenges by employing strategies such as virtual reunification, linked data, minimal computing, and synced transcripts, to provide integrated access to the collections of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB), which are currently split between the University of Maryland (audio files) and the Wisconsin Historical Society (paper collections).

[Implications]: offering a flexible framework for connecting audiovisual collections to related archival collections.|<NONE>|<NONE> <|END_OF_CHUNK|>Human is a strict extraction assistant.

[Background]: Hosted out of the University of Virginia and funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, Digital Yoknapatawpha is an international and collaborative project composed of William Faulkner scholars and technologists. Its goal is to create a comprehensive database of all the locations, characters, and events in Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha fictions with the aim of visualizing the data through a series of 'deep atlases' and other displays.

[Method]: This paper traces the development cycle of a supplementary narrative structure analysis dashboard that allows users to explore the chronology, narrative status, and date range of all of the texts set in his mythic county.

[Results]: It bridges some of the significant gaps between narratological theory and computational methods, opens up a conversation about representing narrative data, and suggests some possible avenues for research with the dashboard.

[Implications]: <NONE>
