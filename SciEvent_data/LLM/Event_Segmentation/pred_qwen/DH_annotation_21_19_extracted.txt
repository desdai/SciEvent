[Background]: The annotation process of sign language corpora in terms of glosses, is a highly labor-intensive task, but a condition for a reliable quantitative analysis.

[Method]: During the annotation process the researcher typically defines the precise time slot in which a sign occurs and then enters the appropriate gloss for the sign. In this study, such a framework (namely OpenPose) has been used to develop three different methods and tools to facilitate the annotation process. The first tool estimates the span of a sign sequence and creates empty slots in an annotation file. The second tool detects whether a sign is one- or two-handed. The last tool recognizes the different handshapes presented in a video sample. All tools can be easily re-trained to fit the needs of the researcher.
