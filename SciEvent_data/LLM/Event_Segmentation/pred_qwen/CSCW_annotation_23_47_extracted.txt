[Background]: It was previously hypothesized that gender differences — and thus gender discrimination — would disappear if communication was no longer in person, and instead was transmitted and received in the same format for all. Yet, even online, researchers have identified gendered language styles in written communication that reveal gender cues and can lead to unequal treatment.

[Method]: In this work, we revisit these past findings and ask whether the same gendered patterns can be found on modern communication platforms, which present a new set of engagement features and mixed synchronous capabilities. We quantitatively analyze 335,000 Slack messages sent by 845 individuals as part of 46 teams, collected over six years of a product design capstone course.

[Results]: We found little evidence of traditionally gendered communication styles (characterized as elaborate, uncertain, and supportive) from the minority-gender participants. We did identify relationships between message author gender, communication style, and message engagement — women and minority genders were more likely to have their messages engaged with, but only when using certain communication styles — suggesting complex power dynamics exist on these platforms.

[Implications]: <NONE>


Paper Code: cscw_23_P_180

[Background]: We investigate how robotic camera systems can offer new capabilities to computer-supported cooperative work

[Method]: Through the design, development, and evaluation of a prototype system called Periscope

[Results]: We demonstrate the system's utility and the promise of shared camera control through a preliminary study where 12 dyads collaboratively worked on assembly tasks

[Implications]: <NONE>
