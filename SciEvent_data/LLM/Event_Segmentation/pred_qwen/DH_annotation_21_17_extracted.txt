[Method]: Greater attention needs to be given to the format and presentation of the underlying data and the interpretation of any data-derived results.

[Background]: Katherine Bode theorizes a new approach to \"data rich\" literary history, in which the researcher constructs a \"a scholarly edition of a literary system\" pairing annotated data with a critical apparatus. Bode challenges the rhetoric around distant reading, arguing it recapitulates the historical oversights of New Criticism.

[Method]: A World of Fiction comprises a book and paired database which apply this framework to the fiction published in nineteenth-century Australian newspapers.

[Results]: Bode's investigation advances new ideas about the gender of Australian fiction authors, the networks of influence among provincial and metropolitan newspapers, and the national character of fiction in the period.

[Implications]: <NONE>
