Paper Code: dh_22_P_29

[Background]: The purpose of this paper is to introduce Linked data from TEI (LIFT), an open-source tool written as a set of Python scripts for generating linked data from TEI-encoded texts. LIFT's goal is to walk users through the transformation process from TEI to linked data step by step, as well as to promote a better understanding of the theoretical and methodological aspects that underpin the transformation.

[Method]: LIFT was created in the context of the University of Bologna's Master Degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge as a teaching tool for students encountering linked open data for the first time as a method of organizing and publishing cultural knowledge and, specifically, digital scholarly editions on the web in a perspective of data integration.

[Results]: <NONE>

[Implications]: <NONE>
