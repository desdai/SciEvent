[Background]: The aim of this article is to present a model for representing in an explicit and formal way the diachronic evolution of concepts and terms in a given domain, so that this formalization can be machine-actionable.

[Method]: The approach we here propose is based on Semantic Web technologies in order to guarantee interoperability and reuse across scientific communities of diachronic terminological resources that can be thus easily accessed, interconnected and mutually enriched. More specifically, the representation of dynamic evolution of terms and concepts was performed in OWL using the N-ary relations mechanisms. A set of SWRL rules was set up, in order to automatically identify the evolution of the concepts evoked within a text, as well as the terms representing these concepts.
