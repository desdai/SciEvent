[Background]: Identifying and prioritizing disease-related proteins is an important scientific problem to develop proper treatments. Network science has become an important discipline to prioritize such proteins. Multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease for which there is still no cure, is characterized by a damaging process called demyelination. Demyelination is the destruction of myelin, a structure facilitating fast transmission of neuron impulses, and oligodendrocytes, the cells producing myelin, by immune cells.

[Method]: We investigated the most significant protein pairs that

[Results]: The reason we investigated these specialized hubs was that a problem related to these proteins might impose a bigger damage in the system. We showed that 61%-100% of the proteins our model detected, depending on parameterization, have already been associated with multiple sclerosis. We further observed the mRNA expression levels of several proteins we prioritized significantly decreased in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells of multiple sclerosis patients.

[Implications]: <NONE>

[Background]: The alevin-fry ecosystem provides a robust and growing suite of programs for single-cell data processing.

[Method]: As new single-cell technologies are introduced, as the community continues to adjust best practices for data processing, and as the alevin-fry ecosystem itself expands and grows

[Results]: It is becoming increasingly important to manage the complexity of alevin-fry's single-cell preprocessing workflows while retaining the performance and flexibility that make these tools enticing.

[Implications]: <NONE>
