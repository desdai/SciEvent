[Background]: The Tesserae Intertext Service Application Programming Interface (TIS-API) enhances the machine-accessibility of the intertext discovery capabilities of the Tesserae software.

[Method]: Instead of requiring inputs through a human-accessible webpage, the TIS-API accepts inputs according to a web development standard.

[Results]: Two case studies demonstrate the contributions of the TIS-API to computer-assisted literary criticism, particularly in increased software development and maintenance flexibility as well as in easier integration of Tesserae software into research workflows.

[Implications]: <NONE>
