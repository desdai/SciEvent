[Background]: Text generation often involves producing coherent and grammatically correct texts that also satisfy a given set of semantic constraints. While most approaches for conditional text generation have primarily focused on lexical constraints, they often struggle to effectively incorporate syntactic constraints, which provide a richer language for approximating semantic constraints. We address this gap by introducing NeuroStructural Decoding, a new decoding algorithm that incorporates syntactic constraints to further improve the quality of the generated text.

[Method]: We build NeuroStructural Decoding on the NeuroLogic Decoding (Lu et al. 2021) algorithm, which enables language generation models to produce fluent text while satisfying complex lexical constraints. Our algorithm is powerful and scalable. It tracks lexico-syntactic constraints (e.g., we need to observe dog as subject and ball as object) during decoding by parsing the partial generations at each step. To this end, we adapt a dependency parser to generate parses for incomplete sentences.

[Results]: Our approach is evaluated on three different language generation tasks, and the results show improved performance in both lexical and syntactic metrics compared to previous methods. The results suggest this is a promising solution for integrating fine-grained controllable generation into the conventional beam search decoding.

[Background]: Direct speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) is advantageous over cascaded approaches for achieving fast inference with a simplified pipeline.

[Method]: We present a novel two-pass direct S2ST architecture, UnitY, which first generates textual representations and predicts discrete acoustic units subsequently. The model performance is enhanced through subword prediction in the first-pass decoder, an advanced two-pass decoder architecture design and search strategy, and better training regularization. Pre-training the first-pass text decoder using the self-supervised denoising auto-encoding task leverages large amounts of unlabeled text data.

[Results]: On benchmark datasets at various data scales, UnitY outperforms a single-pass speech-to-unit translation model by 2.5-4.2 ASR-BLEU with 2.83x decoding speed-up. Predicting discrete units also achieves 2.51x decoding speed-up compared to predicting spectrograms in the second pass.
