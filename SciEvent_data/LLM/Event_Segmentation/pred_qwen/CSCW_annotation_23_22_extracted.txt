[Background]: Digital platforms, including online forums and helplines, have emerged as avenues of support for caregivers suffering from postpartum mental health distress. Understanding support seekers' experiences as shared on these platforms could provide crucial insight into caregivers' needs during this vulnerable time. In the current work, we provide a descriptive analysis of the concerns, psychological states, and motivations shared by healthy and distressed postpartum support seekers on two digital platforms, a one-on-one digital helpline and a publicly available online forum.

[Method]: Using a combination of human annotations, dictionary models and unsupervised techniques

[Results]: we find stark differences between the experiences of distressed and healthy mothers. Distressed mothers described interpersonal problems and a lack of support, with 8.60% - 14.56% reporting severe symptoms including suicidal ideation. In contrast, the majority of healthy mothers described childcare issues, such as questions about breastfeeding or sleeping, and reported no severe mental health concerns. Across the two digital platforms, we found that distressed mothers shared similar content. However, the patterns of speech and affect shared by distressed mothers differed between the helpline vs. the online forum, suggesting the design of these platforms may shape meaningful measures of their support-seeking experiences.

[Implications]: <NONE>

[Background]: While aging adults frequently prefer to 'age in place', their children can worry about their well-being, especially when they live at a distance.

[Method]: Many in-home systems are designed to monitor the real-time status of seniors at home and provide information to their adult children.

[Results]: We observed that the needs and concerns of both sides in the information sharing process are often not aligned.

[Implications]: <NONE>
