[Background]: In viral molecular epidemiology, reconstruction of consensus genomes from sequence data is critical for tracking mutations and variants of concern.

[Method]: However, as the number of samples that are sequenced grows rapidly, compute resources needed to reconstruct consensus genomes can become prohibitive.

[Results]: ViralConsensus is orders of magnitude faster and more memory-efficient than existing methods.

[Implications]: <NONE>
