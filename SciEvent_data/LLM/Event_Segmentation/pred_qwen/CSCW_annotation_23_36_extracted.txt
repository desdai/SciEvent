[Background]: Depression is the most common mental health problem in older adults; however, a lack of understanding in the interaction between physical and social causes hinders effective treatment. Unique issues such as age-specific increases in comorbid physical problems and alienation from social contact can make it difficult for health providers to identify instances of depression. These also make it difficult for depressed older adults to communicate with their social resources, such as friends, family, and health providers.

[Method]: We conducted an interview study on stakeholders' perceptions of depression and communication to understand the opportunities and challenges involved in implementing such collaborative design. Interviewees included 16 depressed older adult patients, 10 of their family members, and two psychiatrists.

[Results]: Our findings reveal new insights into (1) patients' and families' social values and understandings of patients' condition, as well as (2) how these values and understandings influenced decision-making on communicating with each other and acting on depression.

[Implications]: <NONE>
