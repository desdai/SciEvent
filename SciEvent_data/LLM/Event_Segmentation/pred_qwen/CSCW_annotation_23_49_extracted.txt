[Background]: Technologies are increasingly enrolled in projects to involve civilians in the work of policy-making, often under the label of 'civic technology'.

[Method]: <NONE>

[Results]: this paper shows how this grassroots civic tech group creates a civic platform that places a diverse range of participants in contact with the work of public servants, helping to build capacities and relationships that prepare both publics and public servants for the work of participatory democracy.

[Implications]: Understanding civic tech requires a lens beyond the mere analysis or production of technical artifacts.

[Background]: Artificial Intelligence (AI) based technologies are increasingly being integrated into public sector programs to help with decision-support and effective distribution of constrained resources.

[Method]: The field of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) has begun to examine how the resultant sociotechnical systems may be designed appropriately when targeting underserved populations.

[Results]: We present an ethnographic study of a large-scale real-world integration of an AI system for resource allocation in a call-based maternal and child health program in India.

[Implications]: <NONE>
