[Background]: The spread of misinformation on social media is a pressing societal problem that platforms, policymakers, and researchers continue to grapple with.

[Method]: In this work, we empirically analyze the spread of misleading vs. not misleading community fact-checked posts on social media. For this purpose, we employ a dataset of community-created fact-checks from Twitter's 'Birdwatch' pilot and map them to resharing cascades on Twitter.

[Results]: Specifically, misleading posts are estimated to receive 36.62% fewer retweets than not misleading posts. There are significant differences in virality across different sub-types of misinformation (e.g., factual errors, missing context, manipulated media).

[Implications]: <NONE>
