[Background]: Livestreams are now ubiquitous-moving beyond web and mobile-based platforms into products such as fitness machines and smart home assistants. As such, viewership practices have also become varied and diverse: livestreams are used for interactive entertainment, social companionship, and multi-perspective spectatorship for music festivals and sporting events.

[Method]: At the premier in-person gaming livestream event, Games Done Quick (GDQ), attendees engage in a variety of different viewership practices across different event spaces where the livestream is projected on large stage screens, onto walls as peripheral displays, and routed to televisions in hotel venue rooms. This study takes GDQ as an information-rich fieldsite to examine how livestream viewership shifts, changes, and interleaves across physical spaces to provide an expanded livestream experience. From 11 semi-structured interviews with GDQ attendees and participant observations at three GDQ events

[Results]: we found diverse practices of both direct and indirect viewership: the livestream is viewed in collocation with an audience and stage, but is also used to establish viewership continuity across disjoint spaces, tangentially to shop for interesting moments, as a timekeeping device, and even as a means of auditory obfuscation.

[Implications]: <NONE>

[Background]: Research exploring how to support decision-making has often used machine learning to automate or assist human decisions.

[Method]: We applied this tool to a context of people selection, having stakeholders—decision makers (faculty) and decision subjects (students)—use the tool to improve graduate school admission decisions.

[Results]: Through our case study, we demonstrated how the stakeholders used the web tool to create ML models that they used as boundary objects to deliberate over organization decision-making practices.

[Implications]: <NONE>
