[Background]: To date, there has been relatively little discussion of how the UK doctoral funding landscape shapes digital humanities pedagogy for postgraduate research students.

[Method]: This article sets out to address this relative lack, by introducing the inter- and multi-disciplinary context in which many students in the UK work.

[Results]: [Implications]: The study therefore explores learning within a community of practice, the inter- and multi-disciplinary space in which digital humanities practitioners operate. First, drawing on the diverse disciplinary landscape, it highlights an individual's learning journey through self-determined learning (heutagogy). Second, it outlines an idea of digital humanities pedagogy for postgraduate research based on current frameworks of digital literacies and broader researcher development in the UK, framing research activity as learning. Third, it presents the DEAR model for learning and teaching design, which is based on four principles: Diversity; Employability; Application; and Reflection. Fourth, it provides an evaluation of the DEAR model in the context of one UK Doctoral Training Partnership (DTP).

[Background]: The inclusion of semantic features in the stylometric analysis of literary texts appears to be poorly investigated.

[Method]: In this work, we experiment with the application of Distributional Semantics to a corpus of Italian literature to test if words distribution can convey stylistic cues. We utilized a comprehensive collection of Italian literary works spanning various genres and time periods as our dataset.

[Results]: Indeed, the results we have obtained suggest that the style of an author can reveal itself through words distribution too.

[Implications]: <NONE>
