[Background]: Screening bioactive compounds in cancer cell lines receive more attention.

[Method]: Our proposed approach utilizes multimodal input including drug-target interaction, protein-protein interaction, and cell-target interaction to predict drug combination synergy. To learn the feature representation of drugs, we have utilized transformers. It is worth noting that our approach is a multitask approach that predicts three outputs including the drug-target interaction, its toxic effect, and drug combination synergy. In our approach, drug combination synergy is the main task and the two other ones are the auxiliary tasks that help the approach to learn a better model. In the proposed approach three loss functions are defined: synergy loss, toxic loss, and drug-protein interaction loss.

[Background]: Due to many recent updates of both software development environments and operating systems, it was highly requested to maintain Vaa3D and disseminate it on latest operating systems. Additionally, there has never been a showcase about how to use Vaa3D's cross-platform visualization and immersive exploration functions for multidimensional and teravoxel-scale images.
