[Method]: The authors employ a multi-faceted methodology to analyze the FTBALL game programmed in BASIC during the late 1960s. First, they provide extensive contextual information about the development of BASIC and its importance in enabling non-specialists to engage with computers. Drawing upon principles from Critical Code Studies (CCS), they meticulously examine the FTBALL source code, focusing on distinct syntactical elements of BASIC not found in prior programming languages. Their analysis delves deep into the logical structure underlying various sections of the code, illuminating both the innovative nature of BASIC and the strategic design decisions made when creating FTBALL. <|END_OF_TEXT|> <|END_OF_CHUNK|>
