[Background]: In the system and network administration domain, gender diversity remains a distant target. The experiences and perspectives of sysadmins who belong to marginalized genders (non cis-men) are not well understood beyond the fact that sysadmin work environments are generally not equitable.

Furthermore, our participants handle additional layers of work due to gender considerations and to actively find community in the workplace.
