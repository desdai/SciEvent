[Background]: This article explores how the podcast medium as a form of audio technology has facilitated the reimagining of academic publication and feminist praxis.

[Method]: In this case study, we situate the podcast Books Aren't Dead (BAD), an affiliate of the Fembot Collective, within a broader context of digital humanities scholarship and the field's potential to utilize audio technology to realize feminist approaches.

[Results]: BAD, as a podcast, serves as an open-access medium that brings authors and reviewers together in a collaborative context. Audiobook reviews allow for a conversation between author and interviewer, whereby the author can place the work in a broader scholastic and contemporary context for listeners as well as actively engage with constructive critique and questions. The result is a dynamic scholarly communication rather than the static textual product of a book review.

[Implications]: <NONE>
