[Background]: The development of deep learning models has revolutionized various fields including bioinformatics.

[Method]: In particular, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which have been successfully applied to predict molecular properties such as drug efficacy and toxicity, offer promising solutions for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity. This study introduces a new approach called ProBindNet, designed specifically for this task using a combination of structural features extracted from ligands and proteins along with their pairwise interactions. Our model leverages both atom-level details and spatial relationships between atoms

[Results]: Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements compared to existing baselines across diverse benchmark datasets, highlighting its potential utility in drug discovery processes.

[Implications]: <NONE>


Paper Code: bioinfo_23_P_642

[Background]: Identifying and tracking recombinant strains of SARS-CoV-2 is critical to understanding the evolution of the virus and controlling its spread.

[Method]: We present RIVET â€” a software pipeline and visual platform that takes advantage of recent algorithmic advances in recombination inference to comprehensively and sensitively search for potential SARS-CoV-2 recombinants and organize the relevant information in a web interface.

[Results]: <NONE>

[Implications]: <NONE>
