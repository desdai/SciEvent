[Background]: Fueled by Internet-of-Things technologies and spanning a wide range of sensors, speakers, and cameras, smart homes promise to make our lives easier and automate routine tasks.

[Method]: <NONE>

[Results]: Drawing on data from 10 focus groups with 32 privacy-conscious power users, we identify the key privacy risks they perceive from this technology, as well as how they mitigate those risks through increasingly complex strategies. Our findings reveal that navigating the technical landscape that makes up the smart home environment — including what data is collected, what options are available for managing or restricting data flows, and who has access to data collected by SHDs — is complex and often confusing, even for people who spend significant time researching devices and integration options.

[Implications]: <NONE>


Paper Code: cscw_23_P_231

[Background]: Hurricanes can cause catastrophic damage; it is critical for those affected to access information about conditions, loved ones, and resources.

[Method]: <NONE>

[Results]: We find substantial technology use supporting survivors' comfort and safety other than social media. We also observe that designing technologies for high-resource environments — as with many mainstream apps — causes users to decrease use of potentially critical technologies during utility outages, which are common during hurricanes.

[Implications]: <NONE>
