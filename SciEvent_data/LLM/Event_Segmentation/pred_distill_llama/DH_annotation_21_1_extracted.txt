[Background]: This paper proposes text alignment in digital environments as a way to empower language learning. It presents the principles and goals of text alignment in Natural Language Processing, and introduces Ugarit, a web-based translation alignment editor for the collection of aligned language pairs.

[Method]: The study involves the development and implementation of Ugarit, a web-based translation alignment editor designed for collecting aligned language pairs.

[Results]: Observations indicate that translation alignment has been successfully applied in historical language courses at Tufts and Furman University between 2017 and 2019.

[Implications]: These findings suggest potential broader applications of text alignment tools in educational settings, particularly for historical language instruction.
