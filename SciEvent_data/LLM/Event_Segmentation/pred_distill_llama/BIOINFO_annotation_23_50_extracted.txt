[Background]: Protein and peptide engineering has become an essential field in biomedicine with therapeutics, diagnostics and synthetic biology applications. Helices are both abundant structural feature in proteins and comprise a major portion of bioactive peptides. Precise design of helices for binding or biological activity is still a challenging problem.

[Method]: Here, we present HelixGAN, the first generative adversarial network method to generate de novo left-handed and right-handed alpha-helix structures from scratch at an atomic level. We developed a gradient-based search approach in latent space to optimize the generation of novel α-helical structures by matching the exact conformations of selected hotspot residues.

[Results]: The designed α-helical structures can bind specific targets or activate cellular receptors. There is a significant agreement between the helix structures generated with HelixGAN and PEP-FOLD, a well-known de novo approach for predicting peptide structures from amino acid sequences. HelixGAN outperformed RosettaDesign, and our previously developed structural similarity method to generate D-peptides matching a set of given hotspots in a known L-peptide.

[Implications]: As proof of concept, we designed a novel D-GLP1_1 analog that matches the conformations of critical hotspots for the GLP1 function. MD simulations revealed a stable binding mode of the D-GLP1_1 analog coupled to the GLP1 receptor. This novel D-peptide analog is more stable than our previous D-GLP1 design along the MD simulations. We envision HelixGAN as a critical tool for designing novel bioactive peptides with specific properties in the early stages of drug discovery.

[Background]: Reliable label-free methods are needed for detecting and profiling apoptotic events in time-lapse cell-cell interaction assays. Prior studies relied on fluorescent markers of apoptosis, e.g., Annexin-V, that provide an inconsistent and late indication of apoptotic onset for human melanoma cells.

[Method]: Our trained ResNet50 network identified nanowells containing apoptotic bodies with 92% accuracy and predicted the onset of apoptosis with an error of one frame (5 min/frame). Our apoptotic body segmentation yielded an IoU accuracy of 75%, allowing associative identification of apoptotic cells.

[Results]: Our method detected apoptosis events, 70% of which were not detected by Annexin-V staining.

[Implications]: The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our label-free approach in improving the detection and profiling of apoptotic events compared to traditional methods like Annexin-V staining.
