[Background]: Annotation of the mass signals is still the biggest bottleneck for the untargeted mass spectrometry analysis of complex mixtures. Molecular networks are being increasingly adopted by the mass spectrometry community as a tool to annotate large-scale experiments.

[Method]: We have previously shown that the process of propagating annotations from spectral library matches on molecular networks can be automated using Network Annotation Propagation (NAP). One of the limitations of NAP is that the information for the spectral matches is only propagated locally, to the first neighbor of a spectral match. Here, we introduce ChemWalker, which expands this capability to nodes not directly connected to spectral matches using random walks on graphs. Similar to NAP, ChemWalker relies on combinatorial in silico fragmentation results provided by MetFrag, searching biologically relevant databases. Using MetFusion Scoring function, we created a weight function based on the structural similarity among candidate structures and built a weighted graph. This graph was then utilized by the random walk algorithm to compute the probability of traversing a set of candidates starting from seed nodes represented by spectral library matches. This approach allows information propagation beyond direct connections compared to NAP. Additionally, ChemWalker improves upon NAP in terms of runtime efficiency, scalability, and maintainability and is now available as a standalone Python package.

[Results]: The introduction of ChemWalker enabled successful propagation of spectral match annotations across extended molecular networks, reaching nodes not directly linked to initial spectral matches. This expansion significantly increased the scope and accuracy of annotation propagation without requiring manual intervention or additional input.

[Implications]: ChemWalker's ability to propagate annotations over longer paths within molecular networks enhances the utility of such tools in metabolomics and proteomics studies. By reducing reliance on local neighborhood propagation alone, it increases the robustness and generalizability of annotation processes. Furthermore, its availability as an open-source Python package facilitates integration into existing workflows and encourages broader adoption and customization by the scientific community.

[Background]: With recent advances in sequencing technologies, it is now possible to obtain near-perfect complete bacterial chromosome assemblies cheaply and efficiently by combining a long-read-first assembly approach with short-read polishing. However, existing methods for assembling bacterial plasmids from long-read-first assemblies often misassemble or even miss bacterial plasmids entirely and accordingly require manual curation.

[Method]: Plassembler was developed to provide a tool that automatically assembles and outputs bacterial plasmids using a hybrid assembly approach. It achieves increased accuracy and computational efficiency compared to the existing gold standard tool Unicycler by removing chromosomal reads from the input read sets using a mapping approach.

[Results]: The results demonstrate that Plassembler outperforms Unicycler in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency when it comes to assembling bacterial plasmids. Specifically, Plassembler correctly identifies and outputs all known plasmid sequences without requiring extensive manual intervention.

[Implications]: This advancement has significant implications for bacterial genome analysis, particularly in scenarios where accurate identification and separation of plasmids are crucial, such as in studies involving antibiotic resistance genes or other mobile genetic elements. Future work could focus on expanding the tool's applicability to other types of genomes and further improving its performance across diverse datasets.
