[Background]: In not only classrooms but also digital spaces, conceptual keywords are rich tools for scholarship, teaching, and research. This article analyzes \"climate change\" as a keyword in contemporary literary studies to assess how the keyword's occurrence in the MLA International Bibliography frames metadata engagement. Encouraging access to scholarship through effective keyword selection enables finding, citing, and responding to important scholarship. Among other fields, contemporary literary studies and the digital humanities will benefit from shared terms of engagement to encourage precision with terms in a variety of contexts.

[Method]: Drawing on bibliometric analysis tools, I analyze indexed citations from four academic journals: ISLE: Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment; Contemporary Literature; MFS Modern Fiction Studies; and PMLA: Publications of the Modern Language Association. Working with ISLE as a reference case and the latter three as test cases, I find that the occurrence of \"climate change\" as a keyword is less than that of a different, broader keyword: \"environmental crisis.\

[Results]: The disjunction in occurrence rates between these two terms provides a keyword problematic that requires further review. For each corpus, I discuss the ramifications of this keyword problematic by highlighting significant intersections and disconnections.

[Implications]: To conclude, I reflect on the benefits of standardized indexing practices for contemporary literary studies, the digital humanities, and emergent fields such as the digital environmental humanities.

[Background]: The researchers aim to establish a research data repository to preserve cultural research data. They seek methods to ensure their created records persist into the future and remain citable. Additionally, they want to make their research data accessible to a broader audience, particularly those who were recorded and their descendants. The study also focuses on training students in these new curatorial practices to enhance their research methodologies.
