[Background]: Read-overlap-based graph data structures play a central role in computing de novo genome assembly. Most long-read assemblers use Myers's string graph model to sparsify overlap graphs. Graph sparsification improves assembly contiguity by removing spious and redundant connections.

[Method]: A graph model must be coverage-preserving, ensuring that there exist walks in the graph that spell all chromosomes, given sufficient sequencing coverage. This property is crucial for diploid genomes, polyploid genomes, and metagenomes to preserve haplotype-specific information. We developed a novel theoretical framework to analyze coverage-preserving properties of graph models.

[Results]: Experiments using simulated long reads from HG002 human diploid genome showed that ignoring contained reads introduces approximately 50 coverage gaps on average.

[Implications]: Retaining a small fraction of contained reads (1-2%) can close most coverage gaps, making the method practical for improving genome assembly accuracy.

[Background]: The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database serves as a valuable systems biology resource and is widely utilized in diverse research fields. However, existing software does not allow flexible visualization and network analyses of the vast and complex KEGG data.

[Method]: We developed ggkegg, an R package that integrates KEGG information with ggplot2 and ggraph.

[Results]: ggkegg enables enhanced visualization and network analyses of KEGG data. We demonstrate the utility of the package by providing examples of its application in single-cell, bulk transcriptome, and microbiome analyses.

[Implications]: ggkegg may empower researchers to analyze complex biological networks and present their results effectively.
