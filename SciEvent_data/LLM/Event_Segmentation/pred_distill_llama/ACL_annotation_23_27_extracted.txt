[Background]: Large language models (LMs) beyond a certain scale demonstrate the emergent capability of generating free-text rationales for their predictions via chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. While CoT can yield dramatically improved performance, such gains are only observed for sufficiently large LMs. Even more concerning, there is little guarantee that the generated rationales are consistent with LM's predictions or faithfully justify the decisions.

[Method]: We propose SCOTT, a faithful knowledge distillation method to learn a small, self-consistent CoT model from a teacher model that is orders of magnitude larger. To form better supervision, we elicit rationales supporting the gold answers from a large LM (teacher) by contrastive decoding, which encourages the teacher to generate tokens that become more plausible only when the answer is considered. To ensure faithful distillation, we use the teacher-generated rationales to learn a student LM with a counterfactual reasoning objective, which prevents the student from ignoring the rationales to make inconsistent predictions.

[Results]: Experiments show that while yielding comparable performance, our method leads to a more faithful model than baselines. Further analysis shows that such a model respects the rationales more when making decisions; thus, we can improve its performance more by refining its rationales.

[Implications]: The implications of this work suggest that training smaller, more interpretable and faithful CoT models could be beneficial for real-world applications where interpretability and consistency are crucial.

[Background]: Data annotation is the process of labeling data that could be used to train machine learning models. Having high quality annotation is crucial, as it allows the model to learn the relationship between the input data and the desired output.

[Method]: This study evaluates the performance of GPT-3 as a data annotator by comparing it with traditional methods and analyzing its outputs across various NLP tasks.

[Results]: The analysis reveals that GPT-3 demonstrates strong capabilities as an annotator, achieving competitive results compared to conventional approaches.

[Implications]: These findings suggest that GPT-3 holds significant potential as a versatile tool for data annotation in NLP, offering efficient and effective solutions for various applications.
