[Background]: Integrating telehealth in an obstetric care model is important to prepare for possible infection outbreaks that require social distancing and limit in-person consultations. To ensure the successful implementation of obstetric telehealth in Hong Kong, it is essential to understand and address pregnant women’s concerns.

[Method]: We conducted a prospective cross-sectional questionnaire study at Queen Mary Hospital between November 2021 and August 2022. Utilizing a 5-point rating scale, the questionnaire aimed to capture pregnant women’s preferences, expectations, feasibility perceptions, and privacy concerns related to telehealth clinic services. Statistical analyses, including chi-square tests and multinomial logistic regression, were employed to compare questionnaire responses and investigate the association between advancing gestation and attitudes toward telehealth clinics.

[Results]: The study included 664 participants distributed across different pregnancy stages: 269 (40.5%) before 18 gestational weeks, 198 (29.8%) between 24 and 31 weeks, and 197 (29.7%) after delivery. Among them, 49.8% (329/664) favored face-to-face consultations over telehealth clinics, and only 7.3% (48/664) believed the opposite. Additionally, 24.2% (161/664) agreed that telehealth clinics should be launched for obstetric services. Overall preference for telehealth clinics was less than 20% for routine prenatal checkups (81/664, 12.2%) and addressing specific pregnancy-related concerns. Conversely, telehealth clinics were preferred by 76.4% (507/664) for certain non-examination purposes. Participants expressed varying comfort levels with telehealth tasks depending on the task type. Postpartum participants showed higher agreement regarding potential uses of telehealth clinics for symptom assessment and monitoring.

[Implications]: Face-to-face consultation remained the preferred mode of consultation among the participants. Telehealth clinics could serve as an alternative for services requiring minimal physical examination or contact. Increasing awareness and confidence in telehealth, particularly with advancing gestation and postdelivery, may support its broader adoption in obstetric care. Strict enforcement of laws and guidelines could facilitate telehealth implementation and enhance trust among users.

[Background]: Recent studies have analyzed the factors that contribute to variations in the success of crowdfunding campaigns for a specific cancer type; however, little is known about the influential factors among crowdfunding campaigns for multiple cancers. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between project features and the success of cancer crowdfunding campaigns and to determine whether text features affect campaign success for various cancers.

[Method]: Using cancer-related crowdfunding projects on the GoFundMe website, we transformed textual descriptions from the campaigns into structured data using natural language processing techniques. Next, we used penalized logistic regression and correlation analyses to examine the influence of project and text features on fundraising project outcomes. Finally, we examined the influence of campaign description sentiment on crowdfunding success using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software.

[Results]: Campaigns were significantly more likely to be successful if they featured a lower target amount (Goal amount, β=−1.949, z-score=−82.767, P<.001) for fundraising, a higher number of previous donations, agency (vs individual) organizers, project pages containing updates, and project pages containing comments from readers. The results revealed an inverted U-shaped relationship between the length of the text and the amount of funds raised. In addition, more spelling mistakes negatively affected the funds raised (Number of spelling errors, β=−1.068, z-score=−38.79, P<.001).

[Implications]: Difficult-to-treat cancers and high-mortality cancers tend to trigger empathy from potential donors, which increases the funds raised. Gender differences were observed in the effects of emotional words in the text on the amount of funds raised. For cancers that typically occur in women, links between emotional words used and the amount of funds raised were weaker than for cancers typically occurring among men.
