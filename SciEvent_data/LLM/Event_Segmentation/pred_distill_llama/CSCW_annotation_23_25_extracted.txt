[Background]: In recent years, industry leaders and researchers have proposed to use technical provenance standards to address visual misinformation spread through digitally altered media. By adding immutable and secure provenance information such as authorship and edit date to media metadata, social media users could potentially better assess the validity of the media they encounter. However, it is unclear how end users would respond to provenance information, or how to best design provenance indicators to be understandable to laypeople.

[Method]: We conducted an online experiment with 595 participants from the US and UK to investigate how provenance information altered users' accuracy perceptions and trust in visual content shared on social media.

[Results]: We found that provenance information often lowered trust and caused users to doubt deceptive media, particularly when it revealed that the media was composited. We additionally tested conditions where the provenance information itself was shown to be incomplete or invalid, and found that these states have a significant impact on participants' accuracy perceptions and trust in media, leading them, in some cases, to disbelieve honest media.

[Implications]: Our findings show that provenance, although enlightening, is still not a concept well-understood by users, who confuse media credibility with the orthogonal (albeit related) concept of provenance credibility. We discuss how design choices may contribute to provenance (mis)understanding, and conclude with implications for usable provenance systems, including clearer interfaces and user education.

[Background]: While commercial conversational agents (CA) (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, Alexa) are widely used, these systems have limitations in error-handling, flexibility, personalization, and overall dialogue management that are amplified in care coordination settings.

[Method]: This study synthesizes and articulates these limitations through quantitative and qualitative analysis of 56 older adults interacting with a commercial CA deployed in their homes for a 10-week period. The CA is examined as a compensatory technology within an older adult's care network.

[Results]: <NONE>

[Implications]: The authors argue that CA limitations stem from their rigid cue-and-response interaction style typical of task-oriented designs. They propose a redesigned conversation flow aimed at enhancing flexibility and personalization without compromising current AI and machine learning capabilities. Design trade-offs between usability for older adults and efficiency/privacy-driven optimizations are explored.
