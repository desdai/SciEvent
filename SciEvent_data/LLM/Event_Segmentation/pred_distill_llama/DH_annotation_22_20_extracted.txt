[Background]: This paper focuses on the practical realities of implementing the most common minimal computing methods for web development. It addresses the amount of technically-oriented detail-work required to configure the complex set of components that underpin widely-used platforms for static site generation.

[Method]: When going 'minimal' requires a great deal of technical labor, what implications does that have for its adoption by scholars without ongoing technical support, or the money or connections to delegate that work?

[Results]: <NONE>

[Implications]: The added emotional labor for technical collaborators who are only allowed to 'consult' with scholars, when they attempt to coach scholars through implementing a minimal computing site on their own.

[Background]: The purpose of this paper is to introduce Linked data from TEI (LIFT), an open-source tool written as a set of Python scripts for generating linked data from TEI-encoded texts.

[Method]: LIFT, developed as a set of Python scripts, walks users through the transformation process from TEI to linked data step by step.

[Results]: By utilizing LIFT, users gain a structured method for converting TEI-encoded texts into linked data formats suitable for online publication and data integration.

[Implications]: This tool serves as an essential educational resource for students studying digital humanities, offering them hands-on experience in handling linked open data and fostering a deeper comprehension of data integration within cultural knowledge domains.
