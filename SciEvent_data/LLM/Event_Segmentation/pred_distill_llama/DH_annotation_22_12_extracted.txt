Paper Code: dh_22_P_04

[Background]: My Day of DH (Digital Humanities) 2020 included an hour-long talk with a social media platform about diversity and inclusion on said platform. Following their initial inquiry, I raised concern around the language of 'inclusion,' countering that inclusion implies bringing people into an already existing center. I asked if their BIPOC users really wanted to be included or if they wanted to be allowed to exist on the platform without being disproportionately surveiled. My ability to garner the attention of a social media platform and then critique its work is not something I envisioned for myself when I started out in DH.

[Method]: <NONE>

[Results]: <NONE>

[Implications]: <NONE>
