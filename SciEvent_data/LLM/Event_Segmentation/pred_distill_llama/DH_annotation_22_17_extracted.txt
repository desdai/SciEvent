[Background]: The process of making digital objects available and discoverable demands a great deal of labor, from digitization, to creating metadata, to preservation, to importing it into a digital asset management system, and finally to presenting it.

[Method]: We begin this essay with a case study of one such system, called 'Vault,' in the University of Victoria Libraries, and the work required to migrate from a Software as a Service (SaaS) model (called ContentDM) to a free and open-source software (FOSS) model (a customized instance of Samvera).

[Results]: <NONE>

[Implications]: <NONE>

[Background]: In this paper, we explore the material conditions of scholarship and digital editorial work that make uncovering nineteenth-century women’s lives possible in the twenty-first century.

[Method]: Taking our project, Digital Dinah Craik, a TEI-edition of the letters of the bestselling Victorian author, as a case study, we discuss research methods that combine digital scholarly editing with genealogy and prosopography.

[Results]: By combining research tools aimed at scholars, such as the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), and the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, with research tools aimed at a more general audience, such as Ancestry.com and the British Newspaper Archive, we can develop more creative and inclusive research methods and in turn, gain a fuller picture of women’s and working-class lives.

[Implications]: We argue that these combined approaches offer new insights into the lived experiences of women during the nineteenth century and highlight the importance of integrating diverse sources for a comprehensive understanding of historical contexts.
