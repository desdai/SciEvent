[Background]: The ZHI project sought to bridge gaps between enthusiasts and intangible cultural heritage creators, assist students in understanding and participating in craftwork, and promote sustainable knowledge sharing among various groups.

[Method]: The project utilized minimal computing strategies, including digitization and online platforms, to enable craftspeople to transfer skills and knowledge, especially to younger generations, through virtual presentations and knowledge-sharing initiatives without requiring advanced technology.

[Results]: By using accessible tools, the project facilitated virtual craft demonstrations, knowledge exchange, and storytelling, reaching broader audiences who were previously unaware of craftsmanship's value.

[Implications]: The ZHI project demonstrated effective methods for preserving and disseminating intangible cultural heritage, offering a model for similar efforts worldwide while emphasizing inclusivity and accessibility for diverse participants.

[Background]: Building on an earlier e-Black studies manifesto from the late aughts, this paper outlines a Black DH, that as a social movement and as a political project challenges without hesitation or apology a still white-dominated field of digital humanities â€“ and is resolute concerning its commitment to racial justice.

[Method]: As Moya Bailey, Kim Gallon, and Jessica Marie Johnson have argued elsewhere, Black DH should be simultaneously experimental, analytical, computational, speculative, and have unique design capabilities as a series of practices and speculative exercises. This paper proposes guidelines or principles to assist this and makes clear that the process of scholarly inquiry with Black knowledge-making, and discovery takes precedent over final product.

[Results]: This praxis is possible if we promote collaborative co-creation models of teaching, research, and service for the humanities in an interdisciplinary framework that centers and helps prioritize Black women and queer voices and perspectives in Black DH work.

[Implications]: The process of scholarly inquiry with Black knowledge-making, and discovery takes precedent over final product.
