[Background]: Promoter-centered chromatin interactions, including promoter-enhancer (PE) and promoter-promoter (PP) interactions, play crucial roles in understanding gene regulation and disease mechanisms. The advancement of next-generation sequencing techniques like promoter capture Hi-C (pcHi-C) has facilitated the identification of these interactions. Nonetheless, pcHi-C experiments remain costly, limiting their accessibility to specific tissues or cell types. Additionally, these experiments might lack sufficient sequencing depth or face technical artifacts, thereby reducing the number of detected interactions. Current computational methods primarily designed for whole-genome analysis using in situ Hi-C data struggle to optimally identify promoter-focused chromatin interactions.

[Method]: A supervised multi-modal deep learning model is developed, integrating diverse features such as genomic sequences, epigenetic signals, anchor distances, evolutionary traits, and DNA structural characteristics to accurately predict tissue/cell type-specific PE and PP interactions. This model is enhanced through a multi-task learning framework and adapted via transfer learning, demonstrating superior performance over existing deep learning approaches. Furthermore, it achieves competitive prediction accuracy when fine-tuned with predetermined biologically relevant tissues/cell types, particularly excelling at forecasting PE interactions. Utilizing computationally derived biologically relevant tissues/cell types during pre-training, based on shared nearby genes within chromatin interaction anchors, enhances predictive capabilities even further.

[Results]: The proposed method surpasses current benchmarks in identifying promoter-centered chromatin interactions, achieving higher precision and recall rates than traditional models. It successfully identifies novel interactions across multiple biological contexts, highlighting its robustness and applicability.

[Implications]: This advanced model offers significant potential for dissecting complex regulatory networks and advancing our understanding of diseases linked to chromatin interactions. Its ability to adapt to varied tissues and cell types suggests broader applications in personalized medicine and comparative genomics, potentially leading to new therapeutic insights and diagnostic tools.

[Background]: Circadian oscillations of gene expression regulate daily physiological processes, and their disruption is linked to many diseases. Circadian rhythms can be disrupted in a variety of ways, including differential phase, amplitude, and rhythm fitness.

[Method]: Although many differential circadian biomarker detection methods have been proposed, a workflow for systematic detection of multifaceted differential circadian characteristics with accurate false positive control is not currently available. We propose a comprehensive and interactive pipeline to capture the multifaceted characteristics of differentially rhythmic biomarkers.

[Results]: Analysis outputs are accompanied by informative visualization and interactive exploration. The workflow is demonstrated in multiple case studies and is extensible to general omics applications.

[Implications]: The proposed workflow has important implications for understanding complex biological systems and may lead to new insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic interventions.
