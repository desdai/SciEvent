[Background]: This short article introduces audiation as an alternate theoretical framing for articulating the significance of personal literary annotations. Comparing commentary on psalms in the Middle Ages to IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) web annotations, we use the concept of audiation to situate annotations within literary study in terms of a more capacious understanding of the individual's interpretation of text and of the reading experience as part of an unauthorized, distributed, and decentralized system.

[Method]: <NONE>

[Results]: <NONE>

[Implications]: In conclusion, this article offers a groundbreaking approach to understanding personal literary annotations through the concept of audiation, paving the way for innovative research in the field of digital humanities.

[Background]: This article describes the creation of a database of over 1 million images of eighteenth-century printers’ ornaments (or fleurons) using computer vision, and how the database was refined using machine learning. The successes and limitations of the method used are discussed, and the purpose of the database for research in the humanities is outlined.

[Method]: The article discusses the creation of a large-scale database containing over 1 million images of eighteenth-century printers' ornaments, also known as fleurons. This initiative utilized advanced technologies like computer vision and machine learning to develop and refine this resource.

[Results]: The study highlights both the achievements and limitations encountered during the development process, providing insights into the methodologies employed.

[Implications]: The primary goal of the database is to support scholarly research in the field of humanities, offering valuable tools for studying historical printing practices. Recent advancements in the project have introduced a new feature—a visual search function—made possible through collaboration with the Seebibyte Project, enhancing the utility of the database for users seeking specialized resources.
