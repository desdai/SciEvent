[Background]: Academic conferences are considered central to the dissemination of research and play a key role in the prestige systems of academia. And yet the organization of these, and the power systems they maintain, have been little discussed. What is a conference supposed to achieve? Who and what is it for?

[Method]: The annual Alliance of Digital Humanities Organization (ADHO)’s Digital Humanities conference is examined through a Reflection-in-Action and Reflection-on-Action approach, considering the experiences of various people formally involved in organizing the conference over the past decade. The analysis covers the last seven years of the conference as well as its broader history.

[Results]: <NONE>

[Implications]: Conferences are central mechanisms for agenda setting and fostering a community of digital humanities practitioners. Through analyses of the selection of Program Committees, the choosing of conference themes, the preparation of calls for papers, the peer review process, and the selection of keynotes, we contend that existing structures and processes inadequately address concerns around representation, diversity, multilingualism, and labor. Recommendations include aligning the conference budget with its priorities, fostering fair labor practices, and creating accountability structures. These will be useful to those organizing future Digital Humanities events and conference organizers throughout academia interested in making academic conferences more inclusive, welcoming environments that encourage a plurality of voices to fully partake in academic discourse.

[Background]: This article presents a close reading of the augmented reality (AR) comic Modern Polaxis, which was created by Stuart Campbell. Possible Worlds Theory was applied to discuss how fiction, which creates its own possible worlds, integrates the additional layer(s) of AR into its storyworld. The analysis additionally sheds light on the reader’s position and how the augmented layer may affect the literary experience. We also discuss how the AR interface may contribute to digital literature more generally.
