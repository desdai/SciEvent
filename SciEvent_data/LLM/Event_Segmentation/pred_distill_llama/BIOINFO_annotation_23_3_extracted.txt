[Background]: The task of predicting drug-target interactions (DTIs) is crucial for advancing drug discovery. While traditional lab-based methods exist, computational approaches offer efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Recent focus has been on applying various graph neural networks (GNNs) to uncover DTIs within heterogeneous biological information networks (HBINs).

[Method]: An enhanced graph representation learning model named iGRLDTI addresses issues like over-smoothing in GNN-based predictions. It integrates biological data about drugs and targets into an HBIN and employs a node-dependent local smoothing approach to adjust propagation depths, improving feature discrimination.

[Results]: Experiments show iGRLDTI outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in DTI prediction. A case study highlights its success in identifying novel DTIs through more distinct features.

[Implications]: This advancement could accelerate drug discovery by providing more accurate interaction insights, suggesting potential therapeutic effects and guiding further research directions.

[Background]: Construction of high-quality fragment libraries by segmenting organic compounds is an important part of the drug discovery paradigm.

[Method]: This article presents a new method, MacFrag, for efficient molecule fragmentation. MacFrag utilized a modified version of BRICS rules to break chemical bonds and introduced an efficient subgraphs extraction algorithm for rapid enumeration of the fragment space.

[Results]: Evaluation results with ChEMBL dataset exhibited that MacFrag was overall faster than BRICS implemented in RDKit and modified molBLOCKS.

[Implications]: The fragments acquired through MacFrag were more compliant with the 'Rule of Three'.
