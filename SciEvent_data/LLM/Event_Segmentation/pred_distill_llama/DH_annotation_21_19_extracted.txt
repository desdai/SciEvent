[Background]: The annotation process of sign language corpora in terms of glosses is a highly labor-intensive task but a condition for a reliable quantitative analysis. During the annotation process, the researcher typically defines the precise time slot in which a sign occurs and then enters the appropriate gloss for the sign.

[Method]: Recent advances in the field of deep learning have led to the development of accurate and fast pose estimation frameworks. In this study, such a framework (namely OpenPose) has been used to develop three different methods and tools to facilitate the annotation process. The first tool estimates the span of a sign sequence and creates empty slots in an annotation file. The second tool detects whether a sign is one- or two-handed. The last tool recognizes the different handshapes presented in a video sample. All tools can be easily re-trained to fit the needs of the researcher.

[Method]: The paper thus focuses on the virtual museum as an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary object of investigation from the perspective of museology and digital humanities and seeks to ascertain whether scholarly and practical impacts are achieved.

[Results]: <NONE>

[Implications]: It also analyses the expected impacts on practical museum work and visitor needs, especially with respect to the tasks museums are required to fulfill in times of crisis.
