[Background]: The Media Ecology Project (MEP), directed by Prof. Mark Williams and designed by Dr. John Bell at Dartmouth, focuses on creating a virtuous cycle of access, research, and preservation rooted in technological advance and large-scale partnership networks with scholars, students, and institutions dedicated to historical memory such as moving image archives.

[Method]: The development of the Onomy vocabulary tool and the NEH-funded Semantic Annotation Tool (SAT) are central to MEP's methodology. These tools have been applied in two NEH-funded projects: one examining early cinema history and another analyzing television newsfilms covering the U.S. civil rights movement.

[Results]: These projects have advanced understanding of media archives and facilitated interdisciplinary research and curricular goals related to visual culture history. The workflows supported by MEP have transformed the value of media archives and enabled new research questions and methods, bridging traditional humanities analysis with computational approaches.

[Implications]: As a collaborative incubator, MEP has fostered innovative research directions and educational initiatives, enhancing media literacy and cultural heritage preservation efforts. Its model underscores the potential for sustainable, interdisciplinary inquiry into moving image histories and their legacy in the 21st century.

[Background]: This paper examines musical artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that can not only learn from big data, but learn in ways that would be familiar to a musician or music theorist.

[Method]: We aim to find more effective links between music-related big data and artificial intelligence algorithms by incorporating principles with a strong grounding in music theory.

[Results]: We show that it is possible to increase the accuracy of two common algorithms (mode prediction and key prediction) by using music-theory-based techniques during the data preparation process.

[Implications]: We offer methods to alter often-used Krumhansl Kessler profiles [Krumhansl and Kessler 1982], and the manner in which they are employed during preprocessing, to aid the connection of musical big data and mode or key predicting algorithms.
