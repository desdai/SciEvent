[Background]: Network representation is a crucial topic in historical social network analysis. The debate around their value and connotations, led by humanist scholars, is today more relevant than ever, seeing how common these representations are as support for historical analysis. Force-directed networks, in particular, are popular as they can be developed relatively quickly, and reveal patterns and structures in data.

[Method]: Although force-directed networks are powerful tools for uncovering hidden patterns, they fail to retain meaningful structure and existing hierarchies within historical social networks. This study explores the importance of hierarchy in social networks and investigates whether hierarchies, which are strongly present within our models of social structure, influence our perception of social network data.

[Results]: User evaluations indicate that hierarchical network representations significantly reduce cognitive load and foster deeper insights into historical social networks. Additionally, participants prefer hierarchical graph representations over other formats.

[Implications]: These findings suggest that hierarchical representations may offer valuable alternatives to traditional force-directed network visualizations in humanistic research. Future studies should address how different visualization approaches might best serve specific analytical needs in historical contexts.

[Background]: The annual, international Digital Humanities conference is what originally brought ADHO (the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations) together. Many see it as a cornerstone of our collective identity which enables collaboration, networking, and the international dissemination of scholarship in the field.

[Method]: <NONE>

[Results]: This response to 'The circus we deserve? A front row look at the organization of the annual academic conference for the Digital Humanities' by Laura Estill, Jennifer Guiliano, Ã‰lika Ortega, Melissa Terras, Deb Verhoeven and Glen Layne-Worthey engages with its call for ADHO to improve its processes and practices surrounding the DH conference by describing the work that has been done to date, and initiatives ADHO is now undertake.

[Implications]: By addressing these issues, the authors highlight the potential for enhanced collaboration, improved organizational efficiency, and greater inclusivity within the Digital Humanities community.
