[Background]: Recent interest in design through the artificial intelligence (AI) lens is rapidly increasing. Designers, as a special user group interacting with AI, have received more attention in the Human-Computer Interaction community. Prior work has discussed emerging challenges that persist in designing for AI. However, few systematic reviews focus on AI for design to understand how designers and AI can augment each other's complementary strengths in design collaboration.

[Method]: This work conducts a landscape analysis of AI for design by performing a systematic literature review of 93 papers. The analysis first provides a bird's-eye view of overall patterns in this area. It also reveals three themes interpreted from the paper corpus associated with AI for design, including AI assisting designers, designers assisting AI, and characterizing designer-AI collaboration.

[Results]: The main findings include the identification of three key themes related to AI integration into design processes: AI tools aiding designers, reciprocal support where designers aid AI systems, and understanding interactions between human designers and AI collaborators.

[Implications]: The study highlights the potential for enhanced creative collaboration between humans and AI, suggesting new directions for research and practice within Human-Computer Interaction to foster more effective designer-AI teamwork.
