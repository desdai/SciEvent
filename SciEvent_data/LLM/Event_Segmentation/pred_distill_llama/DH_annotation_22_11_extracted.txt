[Background]: Knowledge mapping combines network analysis and data visualization to summarize research domains and illustrate their structure.

[Method]: Using the climate communication knowledge map as an example, we highlight the practical and ethical challenges encountered in creating such visualizations and show how they can be navigated in ways that produce more trustworthy and more useful products.

[Results]: Our recommendations balance tensions between qualitative and quantitative and objective and subjective aspects of knowledge mapping.

[Implications]: They demonstrate the importance of critical practices in the development of knowledge maps, illustrate the intertwined nature of analysis and results in such projects, and emphasize the constructedness of the resulting visualization.

[Background]: The relative youth of Black DH as a field has allowed it to be born radical.

[Method]: While some fields have more conservative traditions that they must break free from, Black DH has been able to forge a more inclusive path.

[Results]: <NONE>

[Implications]: The focus of Black DH and this special issue is not to define Black DH, but rather spotlight the limitless, interdisciplinary nature of Black DH and Black scholarship.
