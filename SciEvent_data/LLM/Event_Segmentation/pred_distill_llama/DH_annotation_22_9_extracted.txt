[Background]: We discuss the challenge of automating the transcription of a digital newspaper collection written in Arabic-script Ottoman Turkish (OT), a historical language used during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

[Method]: We focus on using deep learning methods for handwritten text recognition (HTR) to create transcriptions in a Latin writing system, despite the lack of a direct correlation between OT and modern Turkish writing systems.

[Results]: The study highlights the complexities involved in creating ground truth data and training HTR models for languages with distinct writing systems.

[Implications]: This approach raises questions about traditional transcription practices and emphasizes the need to consider domain biases in HTR models when dealing with historically variant languages.

[Background]: This study presents the results of the research project on the Ballets Espagnols de Antonia Merc√© La Argentina, a dance company active between 1927 and 1929 that adapted the model of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes to a repertoire based on the construction of a national identity through the modern and avant-garde aesthetics of interwar Europe.

[Method]: The systematisation of the preserved sources and their visualisation in interactive maps permits research to be carried out on one of the most brilliant episodes in the history of Spanish dance and to collaborate in the recovery of a forgotten dance heritage.

[Results]: <NONE>

[Implications]: <NONE>
