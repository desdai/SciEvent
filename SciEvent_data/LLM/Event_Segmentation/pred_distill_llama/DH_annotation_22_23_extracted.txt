Paper Code: dh_22_P_32

[Background]: This article explores the pedagogical challenges and opportunities of bringing the Digital Humanities into a STEM-orientated and Singaporean educational context. Teaching DH from the inside out — to computer scientists rather than humanists — has allowed us to see more clearly neglected areas of DH pedagogy that are in need of greater attention.

[Background]: This review critically interrogates Wendy Chun’s book *Discriminating Data: Correlation, Neighborhoods, and the New Politics of Recognition* (MIT Press, 2021) from the perspective of the digital medical or health humanities.

[Method]: Chun’s exploration of the predictive processes by which data analytics replicates 20th-century eugenics discourses makes an important contribution to the field of digital medical ethics and also offers unique insight into the mechanisms by which digital humanities scholars can disrupt and challenge the use and application of such predictive programs.

[Results]: Her analysis highlights the ways in which predictive machine learning and big data perpetuate segregation through their inherent assumptions about correlation, raising significant concerns about their deployment in fields like medicine and pharmacology where precision and equity are paramount.

[Implications]: These findings underscore the urgent need for interdisciplinary approaches to address the ethical dimensions of data-driven decision-making and to ensure that technological advancements do not exacerbate historical injustices.
