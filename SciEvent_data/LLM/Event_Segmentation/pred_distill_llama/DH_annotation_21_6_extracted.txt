[Background]: For the field of game history to mature, and for game studies more broadly to function in a scholarly manner in the coming decades, one necessity will be improvement of game citation practices. Current practices have some obvious problems, such as a lack of standardization even within the same journal or book series.

[Method]: Instead, this essay imagines an alternative approach, working in the digital humanities traditions of speculative collections and tool-based argumentation. In the speculative future we present, there are scholarly collections of software, as well as tools available for citing software states and integrating these citations into scholarly arguments. A working prototype of such a tool is presented, together with examples of scholarly use and the results of an evaluation of the concept with game scholars.

[Results]: The evaluation revealed that the concept of software citation tools was well-received among game scholars, though further refinement and development were recommended.

[Implications]: This approach offers a promising direction for addressing the challenges of citation in game studies, potentially leading to new standards for scholarly communication in the field.
