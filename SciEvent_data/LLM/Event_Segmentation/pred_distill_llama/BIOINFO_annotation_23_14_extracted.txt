[Background]: Identifying and prioritizing disease-related proteins is an important scientific problem to develop proper treatments. Network science has become an important discipline to prioritize such proteins. Multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease for which there is still no cure, is characterized by a damaging process called demyelination. Demyelination is the destruction of myelin, a structure facilitating fast transmission of neuron impulses, and oligodendrocytes, the cells producing myelin, by immune cells. Identifying the proteins that have special features on the network formed by the proteins of oligodendrocyte and immune cells can reveal useful information about the disease. We investigated the most significant protein pairs that we define as bridges among the proteins providing the interaction between the two cells in demyelination, in the networks formed by the oligodendrocyte and each type of two immune cells (i.e., macrophage and T-cell) using network analysis techniques and integer programming. The reason we investigated these specialized hubs was that a problem related to these proteins might impose a bigger damage in the system.

[Method]: We used network analysis techniques and integer programming to investigate the most significant protein pairs defined as bridges among the proteins providing the interaction between oligodendrocytes and immune cells in demyelination. Specifically, we analyzed the networks formed by the oligodendrocyte and each type of two immune cells (macrophage and T-cell).

[Results]: We found that 61%-100% of the proteins our model detected, depending on parameterization, have already been associated with multiple sclerosis. Additionally, we observed that the mRNA expression levels of several prioritized proteins significantly decreased in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells of multiple sclerosis patients.

[Implications]: Our study presents a model, BriFin, which can be used for analyzing processes where interactions of two cell types play an important role. This model provides valuable insights into understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying diseases like multiple sclerosis and could aid in developing targeted therapies.

[Background]: The alevin-fry ecosystem provides a robust and growing suite of programs for single-cell data processing. However, as new single-cell technologies are introduced, as the community continues to adjust best practices for data processing, and as the alevin-fry ecosystem itself expands and grows, it is becoming increasingly important to manage the complexity of alevin-fry's single-cell preprocessing workflows while retaining the performance and flexibility that make these tools enticing.

[Method]: We introduce simpleaf, a program that simplifies the processing of single-cell data using tools from the alevin-fry ecosystem, and adds new functionality and capabilities, while retaining the flexibility and performance of the underlying tools.

[Results]: <NONE>

[Implications]: This advancement will enhance the usability and efficiency of single-cell data analysis, facilitating broader adoption and innovation in the field.
