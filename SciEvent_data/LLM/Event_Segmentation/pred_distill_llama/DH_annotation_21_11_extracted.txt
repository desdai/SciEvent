[Background]: This article explores how the podcast medium as a form of audio technology has facilitated the reimagining of academic publication and feminist praxis. In this case study, we situate the podcast Books Arenâ€™t Dead (BAD), an affiliate of the Fembot Collective, within a broader context of digital humanities scholarship and the field's potential to utilize audio technology to realize feminist approaches.

[Method]: BAD, as a podcast, serves as an open-access medium that brings authors and reviewers together in a collaborative context. Audiobook reviews allow for a conversation between author and interviewer, whereby the author can place the work in a broader scholastic and contemporary context for listeners as well as actively engage with constructive critique and questions. The result is a dynamic scholarly communication rather than the static textual product of a book review.

[Results]: <NONE>

[Implications]: <NONE>

[Background]: EuporiaRAGT is one of the pilot projects that adopt the Euporia system as a digital support to a historico-anthropological research on the form and function of rituals in the texts of ancient Greek tragedy.

[Method]: During the annotation stage, performed with a Domain-Specific Language designed with a user-centred approach, the domain expert can annotate ritual and religious phenomena, with the possibility of registering different textual and interpretive variants; the design of a search engine, in a second phase of the work, allows the database to be tested and reorganized. Finally, the construction of an ontology allows structuring the tags in order to perform complex queries on the database.

[Results]: The main findings include the successful implementation of the annotation framework and the development of a robust search engine capable of handling diverse textual and interpretative variations within the dataset.

[Implications]: The implications of this study lie in its potential to significantly enhance our understanding of rituals in ancient Greek tragedy through advanced computational tools and methodologies, paving the way for further interdisciplinary research and applications in related fields.
