[Background]: Structural variation (SV) is a class of genetic diversity whose importance is increasingly revealed by genome resequencing, especially with long-read technologies. One crucial problem when analyzing and comparing SVs in several individuals is their accurate genotyping, that is determining whether a described SV is present or absent in one sequenced individual, and if present, in how many copies.

[Method]: There are only a few methods dedicated to SV genotyping with long-read data, and all either suffer from a bias toward the reference allele by not representing equally all alleles, or have difficulties genotyping close or overlapping SVs due to a linear representation of the alleles. We present SVJedi-graph, a novel method for SV genotyping that relies on a variation graph to represent in a single data structure all alleles of a set of SVs. The long reads are mapped on the variation graph and the resulting alignments that cover allele-specific edges in the graph are used to estimate the most likely genotype for each SV.

[Results]: Running SVJedi-graph on simulated sets of close and overlapping deletions showed that this graph model prevents the bias toward the reference alleles and allows maintaining high genotyping accuracy whatever the SV proximity, contrary to other state-of-the-art genotypers. On the human gold standard HG002 dataset, SVJedi-graph obtained the best performances, genotyping 99.5% of the high-confidence SV callset with an accuracy of 95% in less than 30 minutes.

[Implications]: These results highlight the potential of SVJedi-graph as a robust tool for accurately genotyping structural variations across diverse genomic contexts, offering significant advancements over existing methodologies.

[Background]: Microbiome datasets with taxa linked to the functions (e.g., genes) they encode are becoming more common as metagenomics sequencing approaches improve. However, these data are challenging to analyze due to their complexity. Summary metrics, such as the alpha and beta diversity of taxa contributing to each function (i.e., contributional diversity), represent one approach to investigate these data, but currently there are no straightforward methods for doing so. We addressed this gap by developing FuncDiv, which efficiently performs these computations. Contributional diversity metrics can provide novel insights that would be impossible to identify without jointly considering taxa and functions.

[Method]: The development of FuncDiv involved techniques for linking microbial taxonomy to functional annotations and computing diversity metrics at both taxonomic and functional levels. This framework utilized existing databases like the Gene Ontology and TaxonRank to map microbial genomes to known functions and then applied advanced computational algorithms to calculate contributional diversity scores.

[Results]: Using FuncDiv on various microbiome datasets revealed significant differences in contributional diversity across different samples. For instance, in a dataset comparing gut microbiomes of healthy individuals versus those with obesity, FuncDiv analysis showed reduced diversity in specific metabolic pathways associated with energy harvest and storage in the obese group.

[Implications]: These results highlight the potential of FuncDiv in uncovering previously unnoticed patterns in microbiome-function relationships, which could lead to new hypotheses about disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets. Future studies integrating FuncDiv into larger epidemiological or ecological investigations may further enhance our understanding of how microbial communities contribute to human health and disease states.
