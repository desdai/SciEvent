[Background]: This paper discusses the development of an ontology for Iranian architectural history, highlighting the challenges faced due to the absence of structured knowledge in the field.

[Method]: The study outlines the process used to construct the ontology, focusing on aligning its structure with the complexities of architectural historical data.

[Results]: The resulting ontology effectively organizes and represents key aspects of Iranian architectural history, facilitating better understanding through logical modeling.

[Implications]: This ontology serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in studying and teaching Iranian architectural heritage, offering a standardized framework for analysis and preservation efforts.

[Background]: This paper offers a case study of the development of Hands-On Reading (https://hands-on-reading.atnu.ncl.ac.uk/login), a web app that explores the interconnections between digital reading and writing. The app was created as part of the AHRC-funded project “Manuscripts after Print c.1450-1550: Producing and Reading Books during Technological Change,” which ran at Newcastle University between February 2019 and July 2020. It was initially designed to enable the project to ask two crucial questions: why does handwriting have an enduring relevance in a digital age; can a more hands-on approach to reading lead to a deeper engagement with a digital text?

[Method]: However, as this paper will show, the creation and testing of this app also raised a number of conceptual issues and technical challenges of broader relevance to the DH community, relating in particular to the question of whether reading and writing practices can be translated to the digital world.

[Results]: <NONE>

[Implications]: These explorations suggest that the transition of traditional reading and writing practices into the digital domain requires careful consideration of both technological affordances and cognitive demands.
