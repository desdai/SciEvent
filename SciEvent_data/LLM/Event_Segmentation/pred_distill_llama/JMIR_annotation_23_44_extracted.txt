[Background]: Literature reviews (LRs), while valuable, are often slow, resource-intensive, and become outdated quickly. Traditional systematic reviews rely heavily on human intervention, which limits their scalability and efficiency.

[Method]: LiteRev automates literature review processes by implementing advanced technologies like natural language processing and machine learning. It conducts automated searches across multiple open-access databases, retrieving relevant metadata and providing text processing capabilities to generate term frequency-inverse document frequency matrices.

[Results]: When evaluated against a manual LR, LiteRev demonstrated high accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, it identified 64 relevant papers out of 87 found by manual abstract screening (recall rate of 73.6%) and 42 relevant papers out of 48 found by manual full-text screening (recall rate of 87.5%).

[Implications]: The results highlightLiteRev's potential to significantly reduce the workload associated with literature reviews, offering a more efficient alternative to traditional methods.

[Background]: : Digital mental health (DMH) programs can be effective in treating and preventing mental health problems. However, community engagement with these programs can be poor. Understanding the barriers and enablers of DMH program use may assist in identifying ways to increase the uptake of these programs, which have the potential to provide broad-scale prevention and treatment in the community. In this study, we aimed to identify and compare factors that may influence participation in DMH programs in practice and research trials, identify any respondent characteristics that are associated with these factors, and assess the relationship between intentions to use DMH programs and actual uptake. Australian adults aged â‰¥18 years were recruited from market research panels to participate in the study. The sample was representative of the Australian adult population based on age, gender, and location. Participants completed a cross-sectional web-based survey assessing demographic characteristics, mental health symptom measures, attitudes and use of DMH programs in practice and in research studies, and the factors influencing their use in both settings. Across both research and practice, trust in the organization delivering the service or trial was the top-ranked factor influencing participation, followed by anonymity or privacy and adequate information. There was little variation in rankings across demographic groups, including intentions to use DMH programs or mental health status. Intentions to use DMH programs were a strong predictor of both current (odds ratio 2.50, 99% CI 1.41-4.43; P<.001) and past (odds ratio 2.98, 99% CI 1.71-5.19; P<.001) use behaviors. Efforts to increase the uptake of DMH programs or participation in research trials should focus on clearly communicating the following to users: the legitimacy of the organization delivering the program, security and use of participant data, and effectiveness of DMH programs.
