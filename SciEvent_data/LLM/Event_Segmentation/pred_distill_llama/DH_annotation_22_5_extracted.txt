[Background]: This collaboration involved ten intergenerational scholars and two community organizations, resulting in three digital exhibitions centered on post-1945 Toronto-based queer and trans activist history. These include \"Not a Place on the Map: The Desh Pardesh Project,\" the Foolscap Gay Oral History Project, and *gendertrash from hell*.

[Method]: The researchers analyzed their work using concepts like radical pedagogy and critical digital humanities (DH), focusing on mapping physical spaces into digital formats, managing metadata, and designing user-friendly interfaces to engage users emotionally and physically with historical materials. They employed the framework of trans(affective)mediation, considering the conversion of analog materials to digital archives within the contexts of anti-racist trans studies, affect theory, and community-driven DH practices.

[Results]: By applying trans(affective)mediation, they aimed to challenge the dominance of white and cis-normative perspectives within LGBTQ+ community archives and DH tools, offering alternative approaches that prioritize community engagement and inclusivity.

[Implications]: Their findings suggest new possibilities for creating more inclusive and community-responsive digital resources in LGBTQ+ archival work, potentially influencing future projects and methodologies in DH.

[Background]: Roopika Risamâ€™s New Digital Worlds interrogates the ongoing digitization of analog cultural records that came into existence during colonial times. Risam contends that the processes which produced the initial analog records were often animated by a mix of ethical egoism, racial bias and cultural caricature. Risam proposes a way out by embracing decolonial computing: a spectrum of techniques that seek to elevate historically-disadvantaged worldviews. Risam hopes to employ interventionist data approaches to address the challenges brought to bear upon peoples continually affected by colonial aggression.

[Method]: The study employs decolonial computing as a framework for re-examining historical texts and cultural artifacts. It utilizes interventionist data approaches to challenge dominant narratives embedded within these records.

[Results]: Initial analysis reveals that decolonial computing effectively disrupts the ethnocentric perspectives inherent in traditional digitization methods. Early interventions demonstrate improved representation of marginalized voices and cultures.

[Implications]: This approach has significant implications for digital humanities and postcolonial studies. By integrating decolonial computing, researchers can create more inclusive and equitable digital archives. Future work should focus on developing scalable tools and methodologies to broaden access to this approach.
