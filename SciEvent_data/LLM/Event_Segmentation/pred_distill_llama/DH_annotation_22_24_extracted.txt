[Background]: This should cover problem, motivation, context, research gaps, or objectives. So, looking at the abstract, I'll look for parts that talk about why OpenArabicPE was created, its purpose, challenges faced, etc. 2.

[Method]: Here, techniques, experimental setups, frameworks, and datasets come into play. In the abstract, there might be details about how OpenArabicPE operates, technologies used, collaborations, or methodologies applied. 3.

[Results]: Main findings, discoveries, stats, or trends. From the abstract, I'm searching for outcomes achieved through the project, like number of editions, articles, words processed, contributions made despite constraints. 4.

[Implications]: Importance, impact, applications, or future work. This would involve discussing how OpenArabicPE affects the field, its significance, potential uses beyond the current scope, and suggestions for further development. Now, applying these to the provided abstract: Looking at the first part: \"This paper introduces and evaluates the project...\" — This seems to set up the background, explaining the introduction and evaluation of OpenArabicPE. Next sentence: \"It confronts hyperbolic promises...\" — Discusses the broader context, which relates to motivations and challenges, fitting under Background. Third sentence talks about OpenArabicPE being a framework, addressing specific societies' needs, so also Background. Fourth sentence mentions the framework's operation without funding, using repurposed data — still within Background as it explains the setup and constraints. Moving on, the fifth sentence starts talking about the hosting of editions, numbers involved — this could fall under either Background or perhaps Method if it's detailing specifics. Wait, but since the next sentence says \"without any funding\" again, maybe it's continuing the Background. Then, after that, it goes into the technical aspects: \"run by volunteers... re-purposing data...\", which touches on methodology — how they're achieving things with limited resources, so possibly entering the Method section. The last sentence before implications: \"Centered around generosity and minimal computing...\" — That sounds like a core principle, perhaps moving towards Implications. So, breaking down: - First two paragraphs: Background - Next paragraph: Still Background, setting up the challenge - Then moves into Method details - Finally, hints at Implications But wait, the exact point where it shifts may not be clear. Let me read carefully: After establishing the project, the second paragraph discusses the societal context and challenges, then the third paragraph describes the operational aspects (volunteers, hosted editions, word count). The fourth paragraph centers on principles (generosity, minimalism), which ties back to both method and implications. Hmm, tricky. Maybe the shift happens when it starts mentioning the scale (6 editions, 630 issues, millions of words) — that’s a result, hence falls under Results. Yes, because it's stating achievements against the backdrop of challenges, so that's results. Therefore, the structure becomes: Background: first three paragraphs. Method: next paragraph about operations. Results: final paragraph with numbers. Implications: none explicitly mentioned here? Wait, actually, the conclusion does touch on the significance relative to global north resources, suggesting broader impacts, thus implying importance and serving as implications. Alternatively, considering the original example, the user had four sections, including all four categories even if some were less explicit. In the sample response, the entire abstract was divided into four sections accordingly. Given that, perhaps the best way is to parse each sentence and assign them sequentially. Let me try: Sentence 1: Introduction to OpenArabicPE – Background. Sentence 2: Confronting hyperbolic promises – Background. Sentence 3: Framework for open, collaborative, scholarly digital editions – Background. Sentence 4: Addresses specific affordances… – Background. Sentence 5: Material heritage issues – Background. Sentence 6: Challenges due to non-Latin scripts – Background. Sentence 7: Contemporary heirs can't rely on Global North resources – Background. Sentence 8: Operated by volunteers, hosting 6 editions, 630 issues, >7m words – Result. No mention of implications directly, unless we consider the last sentence as such. Wait, the last sentence says \"by re-purposing data…\" which is more about the method. And the previous sentence ends with \"and more than 7 million words\", which is a result. Then, the following sentence: \"Centered around generosity and minimal computing,\" – this is about the approach, so Method. Finally, \"OpenArabicPE is run by volunteers and currently hosts six editions with some 630 journal issues and more than 7 million words, without any funding, by re-purposing data, software, and infrastructures.\" – This combines both method and results. I think the key is to take each complete sentence and see whether it belongs to Background, Method, Results, or Implications. Thus: 1. Sentence 1: Introduces project → Background. 2. Sentence 2: Confronts hyperbolic promises → Background. 3. Sentence 3: Framework description → Background. 4. Sentence 4: Affordances → Background. 5. Sentence 5: Material heritage issues → Background. 6. Sentence 6: Non-Latin scripts issue → Background. 7. Sentence 7: Resources unavailable → Background. 8. Sentence 8: Hosting edition info → Results. 9. Sentence 9: Repurposing data → Method. 10

[Background]: In this paper, we present our preliminary reflections on whether minimal computing as a practice can extend beyond \"computing done under some technological constraints\" to serve as a common ground between different digital humanities research dynamics in the Global North and South. We explore this question by commenting on our experience in developing and teaching an undergraduate course to students enrolled from both the University of Maryland, College Park in the United States and Universidad del Salvador in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The class was delivered for its first iteration in September–November 2020 and introduced students to digital publishing and textual scholarship of bilingual Spanish and English texts, presenting minimal computing as a shared set of values including: use of open technologies, ownership of data and code, and reduction in computing infrastructure.

[Method]: The study involved the development and implementation of an undergraduate course that integrated minimal computing concepts into the curriculum. Students from both universities participated in collaborative learning activities focused on digital publishing and textual analysis of bilingual materials. The course emphasized open-source tools, data ownership, and efficient computational practices as key components of minimal computing.

[Results]: Initial feedback from students indicated positive engagement with the minimal computing framework presented in the course. There were notable differences in how students from each institution approached and interpreted the concepts, reflecting broader cultural and academic contexts. These early insights suggest that minimal computing has potential as a bridging concept within global digital humanities communities.

[Implications]: The implications of these findings highlight the importance of fostering international collaborations that promote shared computational practices. Minimal computing offers a promising avenue for creating accessible and inclusive methodologies within digital humanities, particularly when applied across institutional and national boundaries. Future research could further explore the scalability and adaptability of minimal computing approaches in various disciplinary and regional settings.
