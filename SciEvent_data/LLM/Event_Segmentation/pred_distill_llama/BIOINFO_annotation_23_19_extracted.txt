[Background]: Automated extraction of participants, intervention, comparison/control, and outcome (PICO) from the randomized controlled trial (RCT) abstracts is important for evidence synthesis. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of applying natural language processing (NLP) for PICO extraction. However, the performance is not optimal due to the complexity of PICO information in RCT abstracts and the challenges involved in their annotation.

[Background]: We developed the eccDB database to integrate available resources for extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) data.

[Method]: The database provides regulatory and epigenetic information on eccDNAs, with a focus on analyzing intrachromosomal and interchromosomal interactions to predict their transcriptional regulatory functions. Moreover, eccDB identifies eccDNAs from unknown DNA sequences and analyzes the functional and evolutionary relationships of eccDNAs among different species.

[Results]: <NONE>

[Implications]: Overall, eccDB offers web-based analytical tools and a comprehensive resource for biologists and clinicians to decipher the molecular regulatory mechanisms of eccDNAs.
