[Background]: Social media offers an alternative source for entrepreneurs to expand their social networks and obtain relevant resources to support their ambitions. Aspiring entrepreneurs with limited access to resources and social networks might rely more on the opportunities that social media tools offer. Aspiring entrepreneurs navigate social media to realize their economic dreams. Yet, those who face financial constraints often face challenges. Because aspiring entrepreneurs are transitioning to entrepreneurship, they must construct and even adapt to new work-role identities and new requisite skills, behaviors, attitudes, and patterns of interactions.

[Method]: This work examines how aspiring entrepreneurs living in a financially-constrained environment seek informational, social, and emotional support online and navigate their transition to entrepreneurship. These entrepreneurs obtained informational and emotional resources from observing other members' posts in online communities, including the next steps needed to adapt to their desired small business work roles. However, few publicly disclosed their informational or emotional needs online.

[Results]: <NONE>

[Implications]: The study extends existing research on financially-constrained entrepreneurs' use of social media by contributing insights into how these resource-seeking practices limit their exploration of alternative entrepreneurial identities and feedback. It also contributes design implications to facilitate their online disclosure practices, including suggesting ways to respond to questions and other disclosures in ways that restore trust and mitigate identity threats.

[Background]: Twitter accounts are public by default, but Twitter gives the option to create protected accounts, where only approved followers can see their tweets. The publicly visible information changes based on the account type and the visibility of tweets also depends solely on the poster's account type which can cause unintended disclosures especially when users interact.

[Method]: We surveyed 336 Twitter users to understand users' awareness of account information visibility, as well as the tweet visibility when users interact.

[Results]: Our participants are aware of the visibility of their profile information and individual tweets. However, the visibility of followed topics, lists, and interactions with protected accounts is confusing. Only 31% of the participants were aware that a reply by a public account to a protected account's tweet would be publicly visible. Surprisingly, having a protected account does not result in a better understanding of the account information or tweet visibility.

[Implications]: This suggests that there may be gaps in user understanding regarding how different types of interactions affect tweet visibility on Twitter. Future research could focus on developing tools or features within Twitter to help users better manage their privacy settings and understand how their actions influence others' perceptions of them.
