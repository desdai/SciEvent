[Background]: This article presents a case study of Kinolab, a digital platform for the analysis of narrative film language. It describes the need for a scholarly database of clips focusing on film language for cinema and media studies faculty and students, highlighting recent technological and legal advances that have created a favorable environment for this kind of digital humanities work. Discussion of the project is situated within the broader context of contemporary developments in moving image annotation and a discussion of the unique challenges poised by computationally-driven moving image analysis. The article also argues for a universally accepted data model for film language to facilitate the academic crowdsourcing of film clips and the sharing of research and resources across the Semantic Web.

[Method]: The article discusses the development of a digital platform called Kinolab designed for analyzing narrative film language. It emphasizes the creation of a scholarly database containing video clips related to film language studies for academia. Technological advancements and legal considerations are highlighted as factors enabling such digital humanities initiatives. The project is contextualized within current trends in moving image annotation and computational analysis techniques specific to moving images. A proposed universal data model for film language is introduced to support collaborative efforts in sourcing film clips and sharing research through the Semantic Web framework.

[Results]: Not explicitly provided in the given text.

[Implications]: The implications include enhancing academic collaboration through shared resources and standardized data models, facilitating access to film clip analyses, and advancing digital humanities projects involving moving image studies. Future directions may involve refining the proposed data model and expanding its adoption across various institutions and disciplines.
