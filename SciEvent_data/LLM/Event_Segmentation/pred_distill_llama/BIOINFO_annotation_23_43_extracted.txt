[Background]: Pathway inference methods are important for annotating the genome, for providing insights into the mechanisms of biochemical processes and allow the discovery of signaling members and potential new drug targets. Here, we tested the hypothesis that genes with similar impact on cell viability across multiple cell lines belong to a common pathway, thus providing a conceptual basis for a pathway inference method based on correlated anti-proliferative gene properties.

[Method]: We developed a method called functional pathway inference analysis (FPIA) using data from recent large-scale RNAi screens to systematically identify correlated gene dependencies. Initially, we focused on the PI3K/AKT/MTOR signaling pathway, a well-understood oncogenic pathway, to validate FPIA.

[Results]: Using FPIA, we found that dependencies for AKT1, MTOR, and PDPK1 strongly correlated with those for PIK3CA (which encodes PI3KÎ±). Conversely, negative regulators like PTEN showed anti-correlations. Additionally, FPIA revealed stronger correlations within the PI3K-Akt pathway compared to other pathways. When applied to the p53 and MAPK pathways, FPIA also identified relevant interactions, such as MDM2 with TP53BP1 for p53 and MAPK1 with BRAF for MEK1.

[Implications]: The overrepresentation of FPIA-derived genes within specific pathways supports its validity. Furthermore, applying FPIA to particular tumor lineages can uncover cell-type-specific networks, highlighting its utility in targeted therapeutic approaches. This study demonstrates FPIA's effectiveness in identifying key components of survival pathways in cancer cells, offering valuable insights for drug development and personalized treatment strategies.

[Background]: Microbial secondary metabolites exhibit potential medicinal value. A large number of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in the human gut microbiome, which exhibit essential biological activity in microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions, have not been adequately characterized, making it difficult to prioritize these BGCs for experimental characterization.

[Method]: The sBGC-hm atlas is built using gene co-occurrence matrices derived from Human Microbiome Project data, enabling optimization of BGC structures through analysis of microbial communities.

[Results]: This resource provides insights into the functional roles and distributions of secondary metabolite BGCs within the human gut microbiome, aiding in their prioritization for further study.

[Implications]: The sBGC-hm atlas serves as a valuable tool for researchers exploring the therapeutic potentials of natural products derived from microbial secondary metabolism, facilitating targeted experiments and drug discovery efforts.
