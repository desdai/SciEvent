[Background]: There are a number of risks to interpretability found in the growing use of complicated computational methods within the humanities.

[Method]: Greater attention needs to be given to the format and presentation of the underlying data and the interpretation of any data-derived results.

[Results]: Visually appealing graphic renderings of data, high classification accuracy and confidence scores, and impressive summary statistics can be rhetorically structured to appeal to preconceived notions and commonplace understandings.

[Implications]: While making arguments from the summary of significant features might be permissible in some applications of what is now commonly called data science, humanistic uses of computation put forward in the service of academic arguments require much greater access to and grounding in interpreable digital objects.

[Background]: Katherine Bode theorizes a new approach to \"data rich\" literary history, in which the researcher constructs a \"scholarly edition of a literary system\" pairing annotated data with a critical apparatus.

[Method]: Bode challenges the rhetoric around distant reading, arguing it recapitulates the historical oversights of New Criticism. A World of Fiction comprises a book and paired database which apply this framework to the fiction published in nineteenth-century Australian newspapers.

[Results]: Bode's investigation advances new ideas about the gender of Australian fiction authors, the networks of influence among provincial and metropolitan newspapers, and the national character of fiction in the period.

[Implications]: A World of Fiction is an important intervention in conversations about computational literary-historical analysis, as well as around the construction and use of digitized historical archives.
