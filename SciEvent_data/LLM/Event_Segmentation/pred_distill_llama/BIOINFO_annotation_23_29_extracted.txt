[Background]: Dynamic mechanistic modelling in systems biology has been hampered by the complexity and variability associated with the underlying interactions, and by uncertain and sparse experimental measurements.

[Method]: Ensemble modelling, a concept initially developed in statistical mechanics, has been introduced in biological applications with the aim of mitigating those issues.

[Results]: However, since systems biology models often suffer from a lack of identifiability and observability, ensembles of models are particularly unreliable when predicting non-observable states.

[Implications]: We present a strategy to assess and improve the reliability of a class of model ensembles.

[Background]: Protein-to-genome alignment is critical to annotating genes in non-model organisms. While there are a few tools for this purpose, all of them were developed over 10 years ago and did not incorporate the latest advances in alignment algorithms. They are inefficient and could not keep up with the rapid production of new genomes and quickly growing protein databases.

[Method]: Here, we describe miniprot, a new aligner for mapping protein sequences to a complete genome. Miniprot integrates recent techniques such as k-mer sketch and vectorized dynamic programming. It is tens of times faster than existing tools while achieving comparable accuracy on real data.

[Results]: Miniprot is tens of times faster than existing tools while achieving comparable accuracy on real data.

[Implications]: This advancement enables efficient and accurate protein-to-genome alignment, facilitating improved gene annotation for non-model organisms and addressing a long-standing challenge in computational biology.
