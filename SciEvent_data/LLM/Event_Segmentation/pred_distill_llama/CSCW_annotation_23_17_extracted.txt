[Background]: During interpersonal interactions, conversational moves can help people establish common ground—a shared frame of reference to support communication. Neurodiverse conversation dyads that include autistic and non-autistic members can experience challenges in creating and maintaining such a shared frame of reference due to differing communication and cognitive styles. We conducted a design study to understand conversational patterns among neurodiverse dyads and then used those patterns to co-design concepts for supporting the creation and maintenance of common ground by those conversation pairs.

[Method]: We conducted a design study involving two activities with participants: (1) a paired interview with autistic adults and a trusted conversation partner using a novel swimlane visual elicitation activity, and (2) a remote design study where autistic participants designed a game to visualize and support neurodiverse conversation dynamics.

[Results]: We found that communication technology can scaffold neurodiverse dyads in locating common ground through crucial individual and joint decision-making; clarification of language and emotions; and embodied sense-making of identity, relationships, and shared information.

[Implications]: The project highlights two key aspects of designing assistive ICT for autistic individuals: (1) the potential of visual elicitation activities to enhance recognition of interaction patterns, deepen perspective-taking abilities, and inspire alternative interaction strategies, and (2) the necessity of addressing multiple dimensions of communication—social, emotional, and sensory—to effectively support shared reference establishment within neurodiverse dyads.

[Background]: Digital data shape work practices as they travel through space, time, and social situations. In turn, workers shape the materiality of data through different data-oriented activities. In this paper, we draw on the theory of data journeys to develop and present a conceptual framework of four data-intensive activities: Producing, mobilising, processing, and re-purposing. Together, those activities capture entanglements of data transformations and data-intensive practices. We develop the framework through a qualitative study of digitisation in Environmental Assessment (EA) practice. EA practitioners reflect on their experiences working with digital environmental data through ten semi-structured and two interactive interviews. The paper offers two main contributions. First, we develop a data journey theoretical framework and show that it is useful as a unit of analysis for uncovering tensions in data-oriented activities. Second, we use these insights to outline a set of tensions for future design activities in the area of data work practices.
