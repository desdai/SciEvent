[Background]: Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) analyzes complex biological samples such as tissues by simultaneously characterizing the ions present in the tissue in the form of mass spectra and their spatial distribution through ion images. Current unsupervised clustering methods for ion images often neglect spatial features, limiting their ability to leverage these characteristics for effective clustering. Additionally, alternative approaches using deep neural networks pretrained on natural image tasks may not be suitable due to the higher noise levels inherent in ion images compared to natural images.

[Method]: The proposed deep clustering approach integrates both spatial contextual features and noise robustness. Evaluations were conducted on a simulated dataset and four experimental datasets representing diverse tissue types. The method employs techniques tailored to handle the unique challenges posed by MSI data, ensuring accurate grouping of ions originating from the same source.

[Results]: The proposed method outperformed existing clustering algorithms across all evaluated datasets, successfully grouping ions from identical sources more frequently than previous methods. Furthermore, preprocessing ion images through clustering improved the interpretability of subsequent spatial segmentations when compared to analyzing all ions or individual ions separately.

[Implications]: This advancement enhances the interpretability of MSI data in both spectral and spatial domains, facilitating better understanding of biological samples. The method's effectiveness suggests broader applicability beyond MSI, potentially benefiting other fields dealing with high-dimensional and noisy data. Future work could explore extending these techniques to address additional challenges in data analysis across various scientific disciplines.

[Background]: Phecodes are widely used and easily adapted phenotypes based on International Classification of Diseases codes. The current version of phecodes (v1.2) was designed primarily to study common/complex diseases diagnosed in adults; however, there are numerous limitations in the codes and their structure. Here, we present phecodeX, an expanded version of phecodes with a revised structure and 1,761 new codes.

[Method]: PhecodeX adds granularity to phenotypes in key disease domains that are under-represented in the current phecode structure — including infectious disease, pregnancy, congenital anomalies, and neonatology — and is a more robust representation of the medical phenome for global use in discovery research.
