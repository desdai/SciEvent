[Background]: This article examines how Black fans utilize social media platforms to engage fandoms of contemporary Black popular cultural productions. Specifically, how Black digital intimacies are created through examining the interiority expressed in the cultural productions and their fandoms. Utilizing YouTube and Twitter fan comments from The Mis-Adventures of Awkward Black Girl [YouTube, 2011-2012] and Insecure [HBO, 2016-2021], this article proposes affirmative transformative fandom to examine the affective relationships fans have with their fan objects and fellow fans to explore their own intimate lives.

[Method]: The study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis of social media data with qualitative interpretation of fan comments and cultural texts. Data were collected from YouTube videos and related forums, along with Twitter interactions surrounding both series. The framework used is based on theories of affect theory and transformative criticism, which emphasize the role of emotions and reinterpretation in audience engagement.

[Results]: Key findings include evidence of strong emotional bonds formed via shared viewing experiences and online discussions. Fans often express identification with characters and narratives, leading to rich interpretative communities. Additionally, thereâ€™s significant participation in creating and disseminating fan content, such as memes and fan fiction, which further fosters connectivity among fans.

[Implications]: These findings highlight the importance of considering digital spaces as sites for fostering community and identity formation among marginalized groups. They also suggest potential applications in media production and marketing strategies aimed at deeper audience engagement. Future studies could expand on the long-term impacts of such digital practices on individuals' real-world relationships and societal norms.
