[Background]: There is a growing number of available protein sequences, but only a limited amount has been manually annotated. For example, only 0.25% of all entries of UniProtKB are reviewed by human annotators. Further developing automatic tools to infer protein function from sequence alone can alleviate part of this gap.

[Method]: We investigate the potential of Transformer deep neural networks on a specific case of functional sequence annotation: the prediction of enzymatic classes. Our EnzBert transformer models, trained to predict Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers by specialization of a protein language model, were used. The models were compared against state-of-the-art tools for monofunctional enzyme class prediction based on sequences only.

[Results]: The accuracy was significantly improved, rising from 84% to 95% on the prediction of EC numbers at level two on the EC40 benchmark. Additionally, two new time-based benchmarks were created to evaluate predictions at level four, the most detailed level of EC numbers. Compared to existing methods like ECPred and DeepEC, the macro-F1 scores showed improvements: 41% increased to 54% and 20% rose to 26%.

[Implications]: Furthermore, attention maps revealed important residues corresponding to known catalytic sites, achieving an F-Gain score of 96.05%, surpassing classical interpretability methods' highest score of 91.44%. This demonstrates enhanced understanding of enzymatic functions through these advanced models.

[Background]: Sequence alignment is a memory-bound computation whose performance in modern systems is limited by the memory bandwidth bottleneck.

[Method]: We propose Alignment-in-Memories (AIM), a framework for high-throughput sequence alignment using processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures, and evaluate it on UPMEM, the first publicly available general-purpose programmable PIM system.

[Results]: Our evaluation shows that a real PIM system can substantially outperform server-grade multi-threaded CPU systems running at full-scale when performing sequence alignment for various algorithms, read lengths, and edit distance thresholds.

[Implications]: We hope that our findings will inspire more work on creating and accelerating bioinformatics algorithms for such real PIM systems.
