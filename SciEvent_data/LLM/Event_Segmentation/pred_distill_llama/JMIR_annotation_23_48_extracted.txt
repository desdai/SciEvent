[Background]: : Digital interventions for health financing, if implemented at scale, have the potential to improve health system performance by reducing transaction costs and enhancing data-driven decision-making. However, many interventions fail to achieve sustainability, and there is limited evidence on successful factors for scaling up. The Insurance Management Information System (IMIS) is a digital intervention specifically designed to manage health insurance schemes and has been rolled out nationally in Tanzania. Prior studies have highlighted that the IMIS claim function faced poor adoption among healthcare workers (HCWs), casting doubt on its ability to facilitate strategic purchasing and sustainably operate at scale. This study aims to explore why the adoption of the IMIS claim function remains low among HCWs in Tanzania and evaluate the implications for broader implementation efforts. Researchers conducted 21 semi-structured interviews with HCWs and managerial staff across four districts where IMIS had initially been introduced. Participants were selected using a maximum variation sampling approach to ensure diversity in experiences and perspectives. Data analysis employed the framework method, combining both inductive and deductive coding to organize concepts within a socioecological model. Findings were then contextualized through a theoretical lens focused on digital health interventions intended for large-scale application. Interviewees recognized the inherent strengths of the IMIS software, including its technical capabilities and user-friendly design, while acknowledging its value in simplifying claims processing. Despite these positive attributes, several challenges were identified as barriers to more widespread adoption, including human limitations, external environmental factors, and complexities within the healthcare ecosystem. These insights suggest that digital health financing tools like IMIS hold promise for scalability but require careful attention to the surrounding environment, including robust health financing mechanisms, adequate infrastructure, and sufficient human resources. Without addressing these foundational elements, the full potential of such interventions to enhance health financing operations—and thereby advance universal health coverage—cannot be realized.
