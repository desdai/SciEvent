[Background]: <NONE>

[Method]: The study uses qualitative methods, including interviews and focus group discussions, to gather insights from three stakeholder groups: medical cancer advisors, cancer support group advisors, and the general public. These perspectives provide a comprehensive view of trust formation in the proposed live chat service.

[Results]: Experience with familial cancer risk is identified as a crucial trustor characteristic influencing the willingness to use and trust the live chat service. Additionally, participants highlight the importance of certain trustee attributes like expertise, benevolence, integrity, and humanity (e.g., ensuring the service is not a chatbot). Application-related features such as institutional reputation, user-centric design, modern technology, and visual appeal are also deemed vital. Overlaps exist across trust dimensions, indicating shared priorities despite differing participant backgrounds.

[Implications]: These findings underscore the significance of understanding trust dynamics in digital health services. Enhancing trust through measures like providing expert bios to distinguish humans from AI chatbots could improve interaction effectiveness in live chat platforms, ultimately benefiting users seeking reliable cancer information.

[Background]: Oral anticoagulation is the cornerstone treatment of several diseases. Its management is often challenging, and different telemedicine strategies have been implemented to support it. The aim of the study is to systematically review the evidence on the impact of telemedicine-based oral anticoagulation management compared to usual care on thromboembolic and bleeding events.

[Method]: Randomized controlled trials were searched in 5 databases from inception to September 2021. Two independent reviewers performed study selection and data extraction. Total thromboembolic events, major bleeding, mortality, and time in therapeutic range were assessed. Results were pooled using random effect models.

[Results]: In total, 25 randomized controlled trials were included (n=25,746 patients) and classified as moderate to high risk of bias by the Cochrane tool. Telemedicine resulted in lower rates of thromboembolic events, though not statistically significant (n=13 studies, relative risk [RR] 0.75, 95% CI 0.53-1.07; I2=42%), comparable rates of major bleeding (n=11 studies, RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82-1.07; I2=0%) and mortality (n=12 studies, RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.78-1.20; I2=11%), and an improved time in therapeutic range (n=16 studies, mean difference 3.38, 95% CI 1.12-5.65; I2=90%).

[Implications]: In the subgroup of the multitasking intervention, telemedicine resulted in an important reduction of thromboembolic events (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.08-0.48). Telemedicine-based oral anticoagulation management resulted in similar rates of major bleeding and mortality, a trend for fewer thromboembolic events, and better anticoagulation quality compared to standard care. Given the potential benefits of telemedicine-based care, such as greater access to remote populations or people with ambulatory restrictions, these findings may encourage further implementation of eHealth strategies for anticoagulation management, particularly as part of multifaceted interventions for integrated care of chronic diseases. Meanwhile, researchers should develop higher-quality evidence focusing on hard clinical outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and quality of life.
