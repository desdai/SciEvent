[Background]: The premise of this article is that a basic understanding of the composition and functioning of large language models is critically urgent.

[Method]: To that end, we extract a representational map of OpenAI's GPT-2 with what we articulate as two classes of deep learning code, that which pertains to the model and that which underwrites applications built around the model.

[Results]: We then verify this map through case studies of two popular GPT-2 applications: the text adventure game, AI Dungeon, and the language art project, This Word Does Not Exist.

[Implications]: Such an exercise allows us to test the potential of Critical Code Studies when the object of study is deep learning code and to demonstrate the validity of code as an analytical focus for researchers in the subfields of Critical Artificial Intelligence and Critical Machine Learning Studies.

[Background]: This article examines the technical development and afterlives of two projects, the CURSUS project (2000-2003) and the William Godwin's Diary project (2007-2010) to undertake case studies in problems relating to hosting and storage of digital humanities projects.

[Method]: In both cases, a combination of outside events or project decisions negatively impacted the project. This was discussed as part of a symposium for the Endings Principles for Digital Longevity and reflects on whether following these principles would have benefited these projects.

[Results]: <NONE>

[Implications]: Overall, the case is made that we should always be planning for events that could affect the sustainability of digital research projects.
