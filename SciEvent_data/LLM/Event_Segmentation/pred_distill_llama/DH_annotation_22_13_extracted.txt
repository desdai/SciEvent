[Background]: Interdisciplinary collaboration within digital humanities research requires brokering and boundary-crossing work. This article maps interdisciplinary exchanges between computer scientists, media scholars and information scientists to explicate how interdisciplinary brokering affects knowledge and tool production in the digital humanities.

[Method]: The analysis of qualitative data collected during a 17 month-long digital humanities research pilot - set to collaboratively test a digital Linked Open Data (LOD) search tool - provides insights into the exploratory search behaviour of a total of 122 (digital) humanities scholars, and how these insights informed brokering work within an interdisciplinary research team.

[Results]: <NONE>

[Implications]: The article argues that interdisciplinary collaboration first and foremost requires disciplinary recognition in order to succeed, and demonstrates how practical, empirical research insights - in this case about user research - mobilize interdisciplinary decision-making processes. Conclusions indicate in what ways computational tools and collaboration affect knowledge production, and suggest that understanding the stakes of digital humanities research with digital audio-visual sources requires an integrated perspective characterized by both theoretical interdisciplinary discussions and their empirical, practical application. The article furthermore concludes that digital humanities brokering and boundary work should not only revolve around tool development, but also requires self-reflexivity in aligning epistemological chasms between disciplines by means of collaborative translation practices.

[Background]: Digital literary studies encompasses a wide range of approaches, but it often splits into two main groups: quantitative, large-scale analyses of historical texts and close readings of innovative digital literary works.

[Method]: The study employs methodologies from book history, literary sociology, cultural studies, and digital media theory to explore how digital technologies reshape modern literature's structures. It looks at influential digital intermediaries, the merging of author-reader-reviewer roles, and the survival of printed objects in online spaces.

[Results]: The analysis reveals that digital tools significantly influence traditional publishing practices while creating new opportunities for creative expression across various platforms.

[Implications]: This meso-level framework bridges existing gaps by providing insights into both technological impacts and textual innovations, suggesting potential for interdisciplinary collaboration and further exploration of digital literacies' evolving nature.
