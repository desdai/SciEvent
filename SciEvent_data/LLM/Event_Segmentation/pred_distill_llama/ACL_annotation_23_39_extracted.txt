[Background]: We make decisions by reacting to changes in the real world, particularly the emergence and disappearance of impermanent entities such as restaurants, services, and events.

[Method]: To detect disappearing entities from microblogs, we design time-sensitive distant supervision using entities from the knowledge base and time-series posts. This method allows us to build large-scale Twitter datasets of disappearing entities. Additionally, we refine pretrained word embeddings for the detection model by continuously updating them based on microblog streams.

[Results]: Experimental results show that our method outperforms a baseline in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, over one month, more than 70% of the detected disappearing entities appear in Wikipedia before its updates, with an average lead-time of one week.

[Implications]: The success of our approach highlights the importance of efficiently tracking and understanding transient entities across platforms like Twitter. This has significant implications for decision-making processes and could be extended to other domains requiring real-time entity monitoring.

[Background]: Weakly supervised vision-and-language pre-training (WVLP) aims to reduce data costs while maintaining performance using limited cross-modal supervision. Current methods rely solely on local image descriptions like object tags, limiting pair quality and effectiveness.

[Method]: The proposed RELIT framework uses relative representations derived from a few aligned image-text pairs. It retrieves and generates high-quality weakly-aligned pairs from large-scale datasets via relative representation-based retrieval and generation.

[Results]: Experiments across four tasks demonstrate RELIT's superiority under weak supervision, achieving state-of-the-art results.

[Implications]: RELIT addresses key limitations in WVLP, offering improved efficiency and effectiveness for real-world applications.
