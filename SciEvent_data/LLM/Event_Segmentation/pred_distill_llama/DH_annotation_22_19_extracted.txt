[Background]: In 2019, the project United Fronteras began with the intention of countering the official or hegemonic representation of the Mexico-United States border in the digital cultural record and to inspire the questioning and critical development of materials or projects that utilize digital technologies to represent the border from various perspectives.

[Method]: This article touches on the process of how UF creates a transborder model of work between academics from various humanities disciplines and members of the community outside of academia to make use of postcolonial digital humanities and minimal computing practices and methodologies to generate a third digital space that demonstrates the multiplicity of (hi)stories from the border and to document the public memory of the materials and projects in this region. Additionally, the article suggests the use of minimal computing as a fundamental part of independent and autonomous projects that dedicate themselves to resist the structures of power and physical and digital vigilance in border regions because of its ability to provide autonomy, independence, accessibility, functionality, security, neutrality, and material stability across borders.

[Results]: The main findings include the successful creation of a transborder digital platform utilizing minimal computing techniques to present diverse narratives about the Mexico-U.S. border, along with documentation of local histories and memories through collaborative efforts involving both academic scholars and community members.

[Implications]: The implications suggest that such projects can serve as models for other similar initiatives aimed at challenging dominant discourses and fostering cross-border collaboration and cultural preservation. Furthermore, the emphasis on minimal computing highlights its potential in empowering marginalized communities by providing tools that promote autonomy and resistance against systemic powers.

[Background]: Black graduate students from all disciplines, particularly Black women, who may otherwise be isolated in our respective institutions, have taken to the digital as a space to resist the marginalizing ways of the Academy as it exists.

[Method]: We utilize the digital in innovative ways to transform our separate experiences into collectives. Blogs, podcasts, Instagram accounts, Twitter threads, digital writing groups, and more all serve as methods of resisting and engaging in carework.

[Results]: This essay will explore the various ways Black graduate students have decided that the 'revolution will not be televised' â€” but it will be online.

[Implications]: [Everett 2002]
