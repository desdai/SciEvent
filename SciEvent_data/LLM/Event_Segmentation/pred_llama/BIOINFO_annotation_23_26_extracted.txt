[Background]: Developing biochemical models in systems biology is a complex, knowledge-intensive activity. Some modelers (especially novices) benefit from model development tools with a graphical user interface. However, as with the development of complex software, text-based representations of models provide many benefits for advanced model development.

[Method]: [NONE]

[Results]: [NONE]

[Implications]: We present VSCode-Antimony, a tool for building, analyzing, and translating models written in the Antimony modeling language, a human-readable representation of Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) models. VSCode-Antimony is a source editor, a tool with language-aware features. For example, there is autocompletion of variable names to assist with model building, hover messages that aid in model analysis, and translation between XML and Antimony representations of SBML models. These features result from making VSCode-Antimony model-aware by incorporating several sophisticated capabilities: analysis of the Antonomy grammar (e.g., to identify model symbols and their types); a query system for accessing knowledge sources for chemical species and reactions; and automatic conversion between different model representations (e.g., between Antimony and SBML).

[Background]: To allow the comprehensive histological analysis of the whole intestine, it is often rolled to a spiral before imaging.

[Method]: <NONE>

[Results]: Here, we present IntestLine, a Shiny-based open-source application for processing imaging data of (rolled) intestinal tissues and subsequent mapping onto a line. The visualization of the mapped data facilitates the assessment of the whole intestine in both proximal-distal and serosa-luminal axis, and enables the observation of location-specific cell types and markers.

[Implications]: <NONE>
