[Background]: Text generation often involves producing coherent and grammatically correct texts that also satisfy a given set of semantic constraints.

[Method]: We address this gap by introducing NeuroStructural Decoding, a new decoding algorithm that incorporates syntactic constraints to further improve the quality of the generated text. We build NeuroStructural Decoding on the NeuroLogic Decoding (Lu et al. 2021) algorithm, which enables language generation models to produce fluent text while satisfying complex lexical constraints.

[Results]: Our approach is evaluated on three different language generation tasks, and the results show improved performance in both lexical and syntactic metrics compared to previous methods.

[Implications]: <NONE>

[Background]: Direct speech-to-speech translation (S2ST), in which all components can be optimized jointly, is advantageous over cascaded approaches to achieve fast inference with a simplified pipeline.

[Method]: We present a novel two-pass direct S2ST architecture, UnitY, which first generates textual representations and predicts discrete acoustic units subsequently. We enhance the model performance by subword prediction in the first-pass decoder, advanced two-pass decoder architecture design and search strategy, and better training regularization. To leverage large amounts of unlabeled text data, we pre-train the first-pass text decoder based on the self-supervised denoising auto-encoding task.

[Results]: Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets at various data scales demonstrate that UnitY outperforms a single-pass speech-to-unit translation model by 2.5-4.2 ASR-BLEU with 2.83x decoding speed-up. We show that the proposed methods boost the performance even when predicting spectrogram in the second pass. However, predicting discrete units achieves 2.51x decoding speed-up compared to that case.

[Implications]: <NONE>
