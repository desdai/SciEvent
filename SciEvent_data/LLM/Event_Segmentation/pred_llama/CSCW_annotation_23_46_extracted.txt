[Background]: In the context of an online community, online activism in the form of identity struggles can be particularly helpful for marginalized individuals or groups. Since May 2020, students from the 985 universities, an elite educational project in China, have been coming to an online community named 'The Inviting Plan for 985 Fives' on Douban, an interest-based Social Network Site (SNS), to discuss their failure and dissatisfaction in life. Students who were once recognized for their academic excellence now identify as 'fives' (or 'garbage').

[Method]: [NONE]

[Results]: We discover that while peer competition and social stratification in contemporary China cause students at the top universities to feel anxious and lost, the online community they build collectively supports them to create a new social identity, the identity of 'five,' which is the basis of their online activism. Through this new identity, they seek unofficial democracy, civic participation, and possibilities of social change.

[Implications]: We examine how the Douban group, as a social network and collaborative system, supports the group members in their identity struggles in the context of increasingly fierce peer competition in China.

[Background]: Especially in developing regions, parents are rarely given a direct voice in the design of digital maternal and child health (MCH) interventions. Instead, MCH needs and requirements are driven by organizations and health workers.

[Method]: <NONE>

[Results]: This paper reports on the community-based, digital MCH priorities identified in our research, and describes how we approached community discourse and co-design of digital initiatives for these priorities, through parent-centered workshops with low-resource South African communities.

[Implications]: <NONE>
