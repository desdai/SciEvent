[Background]: Volunteer moderators have the power to shape society through their influence on online discourse. However, the growing scale of online interactions increasingly presents significant hurdles for meaningful moderation. Furthermore, there are only limited tools available to assist volunteers with their work.

[Method]: [NONE]

[Results]: Through qualitative analysis of the interview data, we identify and address the most pressing themes in the challenges they face daily. Using interview insights, we conceptualize three tools with automated features that assist them in their most challenging tasks and problems. We then evaluate the tools for usability and acceptance using a survey drawing on the technology acceptance literature with 22 of the same moderators.

[Implications]: <NONE>

[Background]: There are several strategies that can be applied to protect Interdependent privacy (IDP), but little is known regarding how social media users perceive IDP threats or how they prefer to respond to them.

[Method]: [NONE]

[Results]: Participants reported that IDP represented a'serious' online threat, and identified themselves as primarily responsible for responding to violations. IDP strategies that felt more familiar and provided greater perceived control over violations (e.g., flagging, blocking, unfriending) were rated as more effective than platform or government driven interventions. Furthermore, we found users were more willing to share on social media if they perceived their interactions as protected.

[Implications]: <NONE>
