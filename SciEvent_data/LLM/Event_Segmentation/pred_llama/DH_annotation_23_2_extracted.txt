Paper Code: dh_23_P_62

[Background]: Esoteric programming languages (esolangs) break from the norms of language design by explicitly refusing practicality and clarity. While some go even further and make code impossible to write (e.g. Unnecessary), others (e.g. Malboge) retains the ability to express functional and reliable code, despite the seeming disorder of the language. To understand the conversation these languages are having, we must look at how they challenge or re-affirm wider ideas in programming culture and in how computer science is taught: specifically the sometimes-contradictory aesthetics of Humbleness and Computational Idealism.
