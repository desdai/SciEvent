[Background]: Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a disease that commonly affects premature infants whose lungs are not fully developed. RDS results from a lack of surfactant in the lungs. The more premature the infant is, the greater is the likelihood of having RDS. However, even though not all premature infants have RDS, preemptive treatment with artificial pulmonary surfactant is administered in most cases.

[Method]: [NONE]

[Results]: To predict RDS in very low birth weight infants, we used basic infant information, maternity history, pregnancy/birth process, family history, resuscitation procedure, and test results at birth such as blood gas analysis and Apgar score. The prediction performances of 7 different machine learning models were compared, and a 5-layer deep neural network was proposed in order to enhance the prediction performance from the selected features. An ensemble approach combining multiple models from the 5-fold cross-validation was subsequently developed. Our proposed ensemble 5-layer deep neural network consisting of the top 20 features provided high sensitivity (83.03%), specificity (87.50%), accuracy (84.07%), balanced accuracy (85.26%), and area under the curve (0.9187).

[Implications]: <NONE>
