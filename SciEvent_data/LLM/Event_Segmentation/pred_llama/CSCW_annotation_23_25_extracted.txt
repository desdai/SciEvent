[Background]: In recent years, industry leaders and researchers have proposed to use technical provenance standards to address visual misinformation spread through digitally altered media. By adding immutable and secure provenance information such as authorship and edit date to media metadata, social media users could potentially better assess the validity of the media they encounter.

[Method]: [NONE]

[Results]: We found that provenance information often lowered trust and caused users to doubt deceptive media, particularly when it revealed that the media was composited. We additionally tested conditions where the provenance information itself was shown to be incomplete or invalid, and found that these states have a significant impact on participants' accuracy perceptions and trust in media, leading them, in some cases, to disbelieve honest media.

[Implications]: <NONE>

[Background]: While commercial conversational agents (CA) (i.e. Google assistant, Siri, Alexa) are widely used, these systems have limitations in error-handling, flexibility, personalization, and overall dialogue management that are amplified in care coordination settings.

[Method]: <NONE>

[Results]: We look at the CA as a compensatory technology in an older adult's care network. We argue that the CA limitations are rooted in the rigid cue-and-response style of task-oriented interactions common in CAs.

[Implications]: <NONE>
