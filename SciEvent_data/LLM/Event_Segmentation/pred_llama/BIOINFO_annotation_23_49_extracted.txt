[Background]: Biological network analysis for high-throughput biomedical data interpretation relies heavily on topological characteristics. Networks are commonly composed of nodes representing genes or proteins that are connected by edges when interacting.

[Method]: <NONE>

[Results]: We find that improving the interactome modeling increases the number of nodes and interactions, but that isoform and post-translational modification annotation is still limited compared to what can be expected biologically. We also note that small molecule information can distort the topology of the network due to the high connectedness of these molecules, which does not necessarily represent the reality of biology. However, by restricting the connections of small molecules to the context of biochemical reactions, we find that these improve the overall connectedness of the network and reduce the prevalence of isolated components and nodes.

[Implications]: <NONE>

[Background]: Scientists seeking to understand the genomic basis of bacterial phenotypes, such as antibiotic resistance, today have access to an unprecedented number of complete and nearly complete genomes.

[Method]: <NONE>

[Results]: We describe PRAWNS, an efficient and scalable tool for multiple-genome analysis. PRAWNS defines a concise set of genomic features (metablocks), as well as pairwise relationships between them, which can be used as a basis for large-scale genotype-phenotype association studies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PRAWNS by identifying genomic regions associated with antibiotic resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii.

[Implications]: <NONE>
