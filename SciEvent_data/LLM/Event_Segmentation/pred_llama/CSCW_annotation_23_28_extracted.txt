[Background]: Technology use in acute care has so far been studied with a predominant focus on safety and efficiency rather than the experience of acute care staff.

[Method]: Our approach is theoretically guided by four modern HCI perspectives, namely psychological need satisfaction, activity theory, embodied interaction, and media equation theory. We analyzed the interview and observation data using a reflexive thematic analysis and identified four themes.

[Results]: We reported a qualitative study including 130 hours of participant observation on acute care teams and retrospective interviews with nine anesthesiologists on their experiences with technology. The identified themes were technology as necessary (evil), while technology as second patient, technology as problem solver and safety net, and technology as artificial limb.

[Implications]: <NONE>

[Background]: Socially assistive robots play an effective role in children's therapy and education. Robots engage children and provide interaction that is free of the potential judgment of human peers and adults.

[Method]: <NONE>

[Results]: (1) define a dual-cycle model of therapy that helps capture the domain expert view of therapy, (2) identify six core themes of teleoperator needs and patterns across these themes, (3) provide high-level guidelines and detailed recommendations for designing teleoperated socially assistive robot systems, and (4) outline a vision of robot-assisted therapy informed by these guidelines and recommendations that centers teleoperators of socially assistive robots in practice.

[Implications]: <NONE>
