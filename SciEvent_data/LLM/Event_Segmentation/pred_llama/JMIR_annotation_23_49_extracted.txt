[Background]: Social media platforms are frequently used in health communication campaigns. Common understandings of campaign effects posit a sequential and linear series of steps from exposure to behavior change, commonly known as the hierarchy of effects model (HOE).

[Method]: We conducted a systematic review of studies following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines reporting on the use of social media as part of health communication campaigns, extracting campaign information such as objectives, platforms used, and measures of campaign performance.

[Results]: The campaigns were conducted in over 20 countries, but nearly half (n=42) were conducted in the United States. Campaigns targeted a variety of health issues and predominantly used Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. Most campaigns (n=81) set objectives targeting awareness or individual behavior change.

[Implications]: Our review has highlighted a change in conventional understandings of how campaigns can influence health outcomes in the age of social media. The updated model we propose provides social media campaigners with a starting point to develop and tailor campaign messages and allows evaluators to identify critical assumptions to test, including the role and value of \"engagement.\

[Background]: Infants are unable to self-report their pain, which, therefore, often goes underrecognized and undertreated. Adequate assessment of pain, including procedural pain, which has short- and long-term consequences, is critical for its management. The introduction of mobile health–based (mHealth) pain assessment tools could address current challenges and is an area requiring further research.

[Method]: [NONE]

[Results]: Both PainChek Infant Standard and Adaptive modes demonstrated high accuracy (area under the curve 0.964 and 0.966, respectively). At a cutoff score of ≥2, accuracy and precision were 0.908 and 0.912 for Standard and 0.912 and 0.897 for Adaptive modes, respectively. Currently available data allowed evaluation of 16 of the 17 feasibility aspects, with only the cost of the outcome measurement instrument unable to be evaluated since it is yet to be determined. PainChek Infant performed well across feasibility aspects, including interpretability (cutoff score defined), ease of administration, completion time (3 seconds), and clinician comprehensibility.

[Implications]: <NONE>
