[Background]: Obstetric brachial palsy (OBP) is a pathology caused by complications during childbirth because of cervical spine elongation, affecting the motor and sensory innervation of the upper limbs. The most common lesion occurs on the C5 and C6 nerve branches, known as Erb-Duchenne palsy. The least common lesion is when all nerve roots are affected (C5-T1), which has the worst prognosis.

[Method]: A search was performed according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines in several scientific databases—PubMed, Web of Science, PEDro, Cochrane, MEDLINE, Scopus, and CINAHL—without language or date restrictions and including articles published up to April 2023. The inclusion criteria were established according to the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and study (PICOS) design framework: children aged <18 years diagnosed with OBP, VR therapy used in addition to conventional therapy or isolated, VR therapy compared with conventional therapy, outcomes related to OBP rehabilitation therapy, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

[Results]: The results were synthesized through information extraction and presented in tables and forest plots. In total, 5 RCTs were included in this systematic review, with 3 (60%) providing information for the meta-analysis. A total of 138 participants were analyzed. All the studies used semi-immersive or nonimmersive VR systems. The statistical analysis showed no favorable results for all outcomes except for the hand-to-mouth subtest of the Mallet scoring system (functional activity; standardized mean difference −0.97, 95% CI −1.67 to −0.27; P=.007).

[Implications]: Thus, the use of VR for upper limb rehabilitation in patients with OBP is still in its first stages. Small sample sizes; limited long-term analysis; lack of testing of different doses; and absence of International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health–related outcomes were present in the included RCTs, so further research is needed to fully understand the potential of VR technologies as a therapeutic approach for patients with OBP.

[Background]: An artificial intelligence (AI) model using chest radiography (CXR) may provide good performance in making prognoses for COVID-19.

[Method]: We aimed to develop and validate a prediction model using CXR based on an AI model and clinical variables to predict clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. This retrospective longitudinal study included patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at multiple COVID-19 medical centers between February 2020 and October 2020. Patients at Boramae Medical Center were randomly classified into training, validation, and internal testing sets (at a ratio of 8:1:1, respectively).

[Results]: The AI model using CXR and the logistic regression model using clinical variables were suboptimal to predict hospital LOS ≤2 weeks or the need for oxygen supplementation but performed acceptably in the prediction of ARDS (AI model area under the curve [AUC] 0.782, 95% CI 0.720-0.845; logistic regression model AUC 0.878, 95% CI 0.838-0.919). The combined model performed better in predicting the need for oxygen supplementation (AUC 0.704, 95% CI 0.646-0.762) and ARDS (AUC 0.890, 95% CI 0.853-0.928) compared to the CXR score alone. Both the AI and combined models showed good calibration for predicting ARDS (P=.079 and P=.859). The combined prediction model, comprising the CXR score and clinical information, was externally validated as having acceptable performance in predicting severe illness and excellent performance in predicting ARDS in patients with COVID-19.

[Implications]: Note that there is no implication section provided in the original text, so it remains empty.
