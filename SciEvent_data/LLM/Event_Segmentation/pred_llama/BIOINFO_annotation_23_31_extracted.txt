[Background]: The rapid development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) approaches has provided new insights into understanding tissue architecture and function.

[Method]: Although many computational methods have been developed to disentangle discrete cell types from spatial mixtures

[Results]: <NONE>

[Implications]: <NONE>


Paper Code: bioinfo_23_P_233

[Background]: The increasing availability of RNA structural information that spans many kilobases of transcript sequence imposes a need for tools that can rapidly screen, identify, and prioritize structural modules of interest.

[Method]: <NONE>

[Results]: We describe RNA Structural Content Scanner (RSCanner), an automated tool that scans RNA transcripts for regions that contain high levels of secondary structure and then classifies each region for its relative propensity to adopt stable or dynamic structures. RSCanner then generates an intuitive heatmap enabling users to rapidly pinpoint regions likely to contain a high or low density of discrete RNA structures, thereby informing downstream functional or structural investigation.

[Implications]: <NONE>```
