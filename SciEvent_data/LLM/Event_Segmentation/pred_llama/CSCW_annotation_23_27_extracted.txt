Paper Code: cscw_23_P_31

[Background]: Fueled by Internet-of-Things technologies and spanning a wide range of sensors, speakers, and cameras, smart homes promise to make our lives easier and automate routine tasks.

[Method]: <NONE>

[Results]: From speakers to security cameras, smart home devices (SHDs) answer our questions, monitor our home environment, and conserve energy. They also collect significant data, ranging from on/off commands to audio and video data, and they do this in some of our most private spaces.

[Implications]: <NONE>


Paper Code: cscw_23_P_231

[Background]: Hurricanes can cause catastrophic damage; it is critical for those affected to access information about conditions, loved ones, and resources.

[Method]: <NONE>

[Results]: We find substantial technology use supporting survivors' comfort and safety other than social media. We also observe that designing technologies for high-resource environments — as with many mainstream apps — causes users to decrease use of potentially critical technologies during utility outages, which are common during hurricanes.

[Implications]: <NONE>
