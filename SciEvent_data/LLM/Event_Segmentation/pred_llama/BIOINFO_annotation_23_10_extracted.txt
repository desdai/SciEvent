Paper Code: bioinfo_23_P_204

[Background]: It simultaneously characterizes the ions present in the tissue in the form of mass spectra, and the spatial distribution of the ions across the tissue in the form of ion images.

[Method]: We contribute a deep clustering approach for ion images that accounts for both spatial contextual features and noise.

[Results]: In evaluations on a simulated dataset and on four experimental datasets of different tissue types, the proposed method grouped ions from the same source into a same cluster more frequently than existing methods.

[Implications]: <NONE>


Paper Code: bioinfo_23_P_758

[Background]: Phecodes are widely used and easily adapted phenotypes based on International Classification of Diseases codes. The current version of phecodes (v1.2) was designed primarily to study common/complex diseases diagnosed in adults; however, there are numerous limitations in the codes and their structure.

[Method]: <NONE>

[Results]: Here, we present phecodeX, an expanded version of phecodes with a revised structure and 1,761 new codes. PhecodeX adds granularity to phenotypes in key disease domains that are under-represented in the current phecode structure — including infectious disease, pregnancy, congenital anomalies, and neonatology — and is a more robust representation of the medical phenome for global use in discovery research.

[Implications]: <NONE>
