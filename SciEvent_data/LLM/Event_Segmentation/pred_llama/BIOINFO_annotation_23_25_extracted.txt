[Background]: The number and size of computational models in biology have drastically increased over the past years and continue to grow. Modeled networks are becoming more complex, and reconstructing them from the beginning in an exchangeable and reproducible manner is challenging.

[Method]: <NONE>

[Results]: Using precisely defined ontologies enables the encoding of field-specific knowledge and the association of disparate data types. In computational modeling, the medium for representing domain knowledge is the set of orthogonal structured controlled vocabularies named Systems Biology Ontology (SBO).

[Implications]: Including SBO annotations in the models will enhance the reproducibility, usability, and analysis of biochemical networks.

[Background]: Access pathways in enzymes are crucial for the passage of substrates and products of catalyzed reactions.

[Method]: The process can be studied by computational means with variable degrees of precision. Our in-house approximative method CaverDock provides a fast and easy way to set up and run ligand binding and unbinding calculations through protein tunnels and channels. Here we introduce pyCaverDock, a Python3 API designed to improve user experience with the tool and further facilitate the ligand transport analyses. The API enables users to simplify the steps needed to use CaverDock, from automatizing setup processes to designing screening pipelines.
