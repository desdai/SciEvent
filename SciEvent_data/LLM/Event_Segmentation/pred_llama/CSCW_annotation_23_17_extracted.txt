[Background]: During interpersonal interactions, conversational moves can help people establish common ground â€”a shared frame of reference to support communication. Neurodiverse conversation dyads that include autistic and non-autistic members can experience challenges in creating and maintaining such a shared frame of reference due to differing communication and cognitive styles.

[Method]: [NONE]

[Results]: We found that communication technology can scaffold neurodiverse dyads in locating common ground by supporting crucial individual and joint decision-making; clarification of language and emotions; and embodied sense-making of identity, relationships, and shared information.

[Implications]: <NONE>

[Background]: Digital data shape work practices as they travel through space, time, and social situations.

[Method]: <NONE>

[Results]: In this paper, we draw on the theory of data journeys to develop and present a conceptual framework of four data-intensive activities: Producing, mobilising, processing, and re-purposing. Together, those activities capture entanglements of data transformations and data-intensive practices. We develop the framework through a qualitative study of digitisation in Environmental Assessment (EA) practice. EA practitioners reflect on their experiences working with digital environmental data through ten semi-structured and two interactive interviews.

[Implications]: <NONE>
