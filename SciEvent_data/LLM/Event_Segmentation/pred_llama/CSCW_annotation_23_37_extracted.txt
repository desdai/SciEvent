[Background]: Whether those visualizations are shared on news outlets or social networks, platforms usually allow readers to discuss their stories in comments sections.

[Method]: <NONE>

[Results]: We found that chart creators were using a variety of authoring tools to share their content. Readers of these posts, commenters, used text mainly to discuss and critique the visual content. We noticed a need for a richer mode of communication that would show instead of telling authors what to do. Based on our findings, we introduced Vizdat, a lightweight tool and extension to allow users to visualize and reproduce charts in the comments sections of data stories. We used Vizdat as a technology probe with 11 Reddit users to create data visualization and discuss charts on r/dataisbeautiful. During the four-week field deployment period, we observed how Vizdat was used and interviewed the participants. We found that commenters saw value in accessing the visualization specifications through Vizdat and used those charts to structure their replies with richer modalities. As a result, visualization authors appreciated the feedback and less toxic discussion provided through comments embedded with modified versions of their charts.

[Implications]: In our paper, we share these findings and other insights to understand the dynamics of forum discussion around charts.

[Background]: Recent interest in design through the artificial intelligence (AI) lens is rapidly increasing. Designers, as a special user group interacting with AI, have received more attention in the Human-Computer Interaction community. Prior work has discussed emerging challenges that persist in designing for AI.

[Method]: <NONE>

[Results]: The analysis first provides a bird's eye view of overall patterns in this area. The analysis also reveals three themes interpreted from the paper corpus associated with AI for design, including AI assisting designers, designers assisting AI, and characterizing designer-AI collaboration.

[Implications]: We discuss the implications of our findings and suggested methodological proposals to guide HCI toward research and practices that center on collaborative creativity.
