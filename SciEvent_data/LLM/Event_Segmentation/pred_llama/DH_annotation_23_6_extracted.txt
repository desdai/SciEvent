[Background]: This article analyzes “climate change” as a keyword in contemporary literary studies to assess how the keyword's occurrence in the MLA International Bibliography frames metadata engagement.

[Method]: <NONE>

[Results]: Among other fields, contemporary literary studies and the digital humanities will benefit from shared terms of engagement to encourage precision with terms in a variety of contexts. Drawing on bibliometric analysis tools, I analyze indexed citations from four academic journals: ISLE: Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment; Contemporary Literature; MFS Modern Fiction Studies; and PMLA: Publications of the Modern Language Association. Working with ISLE as a reference case and the latter three as test cases, I find that the occurrence of “climate change” as a keyword is less than that of a different, broader keyword: “environmental crisis.”

[Implications]: To conclude, I reflect on the benefits of standardized indexing practices for contemporary literary studies, the digital humanities, and emergent fields such as the digital environmental humanities.
