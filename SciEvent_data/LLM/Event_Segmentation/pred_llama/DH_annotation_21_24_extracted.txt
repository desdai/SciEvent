[Background]: In this article, we present our reflections on hermeneutic data visualizations for digital literary studies.

[Method]: <NONE>

[Implications]: In this article, we present the concept of hermeneutic visualization as a means of bridging the gap between 'classic' literary hermeneutics and the emerging practice of digital literary hermeneutics. Since data visualization is based on epistemological premises stemming from the natural or social sciences, it is not well-equipped to meet hermeneutic demands. In this article, we argue that the digital humanities can meet hermeneutic demands through a critical interface and visualization concept. We discuss four postulates that can be used as guidelines and help transform'more traditional' data visualization into hermeneutic visualization, while respecting the epistemological foundations of hermeneutic theory. We demonstrate the usefulness of the postulates with an interactive prototype Stereoscope designed to support them.
