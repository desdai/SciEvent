[Background]: The findings from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have greatly helped us to understand the genetic basis of human complex traits and diseases. Despite the tremendous progress, much efforts are still needed to address several major challenges arising in GWAS.

[Method]: To address the above challenges, we propose a powerful and adaptive latent model (PALM) to integrate cell-type/tissue-specific functional annotations with GWAS summary statistics. Unlike existing methods, which are mainly based on linear models, PALM leverages a tree ensemble to adaptively characterize non-linear relationship between functional annotations and the association status of genetic variants. To make PALM scalable to millions of variants and hundreds of functional annotations, we develop a functional gradient-based expectation-maximization algorithm, to fit the tree-based non-linear model in a stable manner.

[Results]: Through comprehensive simulation studies, we show that PALM not only controls false discovery rate well, but also improves statistical power of identifying risk variants. We also apply PALM to integrate summary statistics of 30 GWASs with 127 cell type/tissue-specific functional annotations. The results indicate that PALM can identify more risk variants as well as rank the importance of functional annotations, yielding better interpretation of GWAS results.

[Implications]: We believe that our proposed method has great potential for improving the understanding of the genetic basis of human complex traits and diseases, and may lead to new therapeutic strategies for disease prevention and treatment.

[Background]: Beyond identifying genetic variants, we introduce a set of Boolean relations, which allows for a comprehensive classification of the relations of every pair of variants by taking all minimal alignments into account.

[Method]: We present an efficient algorithm to compute these relations, including a novel way of efficiently computing all minimal alignments within the best theoretical complexity bounds.

[Results]: We show that these relations are common, and many non-trivial, for variants of the CFTR gene in dbSNP.

[Implications]: <NONE>
