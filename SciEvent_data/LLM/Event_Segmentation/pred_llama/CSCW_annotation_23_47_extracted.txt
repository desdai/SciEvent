[Background]: It was previously hypothesized that gender differences — and thus gender discrimination — would disappear if communication was no longer in person, and instead was transmitted and received in the same format for all.

[Method]: We quantitatively analyze 335,000 Slack messages sent by 845 individuals as part of 46 teams, collected over six years of a product design capstone course.

[Results]: We found little evidence of traditionally gendered communication styles (characterized as elaborate, uncertain, and supportive) from the minority-gender participants. We did identify relationships between message author gender, communication style, and message engagement — women and minority genders were more likely to have their messages engaged with, but only when using certain communication styles —

[Implications]: <NONE>


Paper Code: cscw_23_P_180

[Background]: We investigate how robotic camera systems can offer new capabilities to computer-supported cooperative work through the design, development, and evaluation of a prototype system called Periscope.

[Method]: <NONE>

[Results]: With Periscope, a local worker completes manipulation tasks with guidance from a remote helper who observes the workspace through a camera mounted on a semi-autonomous robotic arm that is co-located with the worker. Our key insight is that the helper, the worker, and the robot should all share responsibility of the camera view — an approach we call shared camera control. Using this approach, we present a set of modes that distribute the control of the camera between the human collaborators and the autonomous robot depending on task needs. We demonstrate the system's utility and the promise of shared camera control through a preliminary study where 12 dyads collaboratively worked on assembly tasks.

[Implications]: <NONE>
