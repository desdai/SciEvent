[Background]: Bone marrow (BM) examination is one of the most important indicators in diagnosing hematologic disorders and is typically performed under the microscope via oil-immersion objective lens with a total 100Ã— objective magnification.

[Method]: Fully automated BM examination and mitotic figure examination from whole-slide images is highly demanded but challenging and poorly explored.

[Results]: The experimental results demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the proposed CW-Net on a large BM WSI dataset with 16,456 annotated cells of 19 BM cell types and a large-scale WSI dataset for mitotic figure assessment with 262,481 annotated cells of five cell types.

[Implications]: This article presents an efficient and fully automatic CW-Net approach to address the three issues mentioned above and demonstrates its superior performance on both BM examination and mitotic figure examination.
