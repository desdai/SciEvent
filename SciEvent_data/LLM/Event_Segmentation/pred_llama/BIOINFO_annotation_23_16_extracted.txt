Paper Code: bioinfo_23_P_693

[Background]: The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is the only passageway for macromolecules between nucleus and cytoplasm, and an important reference standard in microscopy: it is massive and stereotypically arranged.

[Method]: Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) images NPCs at protein-level resolution, whereupon image analysis software studies NPC variability. However, the true picture of this variability is unknown. In quantitative image analysis experiments, it is thus difficult to distinguish intrinsically high SMLM noise from variability of the underlying structure.

[Results]: We introduce CIR4MICS ('ceramics', Configurable, Irregular Rings FOR MICroscopy Simulations), a pipeline that synthesizes ground truth datasets of structurally variable NPCs based on architectural models of the true NPC.

[Implications]: <NONE>


Paper Code: bioinfo_23_P_100

[Background]: In recent years, interest has arisen in using machine learning to improve the efficiency of automatic medical consultation and enhance patient experience.

[Method]: <NONE>

[Results]: We report a set of benchmark results for each task, which shows the usability of the dataset and sets a baseline for future studies.

[Implications]: <NONE>
