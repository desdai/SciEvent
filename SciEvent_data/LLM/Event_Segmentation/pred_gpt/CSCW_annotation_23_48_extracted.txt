[Background]: Much emphasis has been placed on how the affordances and layouts of an office setting can influence co-worker interactions and perceived team outcomes. Little is known, however, whether perceptions of teamwork and team conflict are affected when the location of work changes from the office to the home. To address this gap, we present findings from a ten-week, in situ study of 91 information workers from 27 US-based teams.

[Method]: We compare three distinct work locations — private and shared workspaces at home as well at the office — and explore how each location may impact individual perceptions of teamwork.

[Results]: While there was no significant association with participants' perceptions of teamwork, results revealed associations of work location with team conflict: participants who worked in a private room at home reported significantly lower team conflict compared to those working in the office. No difference was found for the office and the shared workspace. We further found that the influence of work location on team conflict interacted with job decision latitude and the level of task interdependence among co-workers.

[Implications]: We discuss practical implications for full-time work from home (WFH) on teams. Our study adds an important environmental dimension to the literature on remote teaming, which in turn may help organizations as they consider, prepare, or implement more permanent WFH and/or hybrid work policies in the future.

[Background]: Sexual health is an important domain that deserves more HCI attention, such as supporting the practices of men who have sex with men (MSM) against HIV risks. One current clinical approach to addressing this issue is to use preventive medicine like pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). As medication adherence of PrEP is challenging that involves users' individual knowledge, sex practices, relational status, and community support, technological mediation benefits from a human-centered perspective that goes beyond individual-level support to understand MSM's needs so as to design a holistic technological intervention for them.

[Method]: With an in-depth interview (n = 22) with MSM from two major cities in Taiwan, we drew on the theoretical framework of the social ecological model and identified three levels of influences, including individual, interpersonal, and sociocultural, that shape the enablers, inhibitors, risks and challenges, and support towards MSM's PrEP use.

[Results]: <NONE>

[Implications]: We proposed correspondent technological design implications to support what we found based on the understanding of our participants.
