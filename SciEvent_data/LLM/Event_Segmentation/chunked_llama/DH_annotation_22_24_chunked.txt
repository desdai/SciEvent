    "abstract": "This paper introduces and evaluates the project Open Arabic Periodical Editions (OpenArabicPE) as a case study of minimal computing. It confronts hyperbolic promises of mass digitization and computational methods for the exploration of digitized cultural heritage as a hegemonic episteme rooted in 20th-century, English-speaking, neoliberal capitalism from the margins. OpenArabicPE is a framework for open, collaborative, and scholarly digital editions of early Arabic periodicals from the late Ottoman Eastern Mediterranean. It addresses the specific affordances of a historical multilingual society, whose material heritage continues to be looted, destroyed, and neglected; whose material heritage resists digitization efforts by being dependent on non-Latin scripts and, for instance, non-Gregorian calendars; and whose contemporary heirs cannot draw on the vast resources in wealth and socio-technical infrastructures of the Global North. Centered around generosity and minimal computing, OpenArabicPE is run by volunteers and currently hosts six editions with some 630 journal issues and more than 7 million words, without any funding, by re-purposing data, software, and infrastructures.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present our preliminary reflections on whether minimal computing as a practice can extend beyond “computing done under some technological constraints” to served as a common ground between different digital humanities research dynamics in the Global North and South. We explore this question by commenting on our experience in developing and teaching an undergraduate course to students enrolled from both the University of Maryland, College Park in the United States and Universidad del Salvador in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The class was delivered for its first iteration in September–November 2020 and introduced students to digital publishing and textual scholarship of bilingual Spanish and English texts, presenting minimal computing as a shared set of values including: use of open technologies, ownership of data and code, and reduction in computing infrastructure.",
