      "abstract": "Bone marrow (BM) examination is one of the most important indicators in diagnosing hematologic disorders and is typically performed under the microscope via oil-immersion objective lens with a total 100× objective magnification. On the other hand, mitotic detection and identification is critical not only for accurate cancer diagnosis and grading but also for predicting therapy success and survival. Fully automated BM examination and mitotic figure examination from whole-slide images is highly demanded but challenging and poorly explored. First, the complexity and poor reproducibility of microscopic image examination are due to the cell type diversity, delicate intralineage discrepancy within the multitype cell maturation process, cells overlapping, lipid interference and stain variation. Second, manual annotation on whole-slide images is tedious, laborious and subject to intraobserver variability, which causes the supervised information restricted to limited, easily identifiable and scattered cells annotated by humans. Third, when the training data are sparsely labeled, many unlabeled objects of interest are wrongly defined as background, which severely confuses AI learners. This article presents an efficient and fully automatic CW-Net approach to address the three issues mentioned above and demonstrates its superior performance on both BM examination and mitotic figure examination. The experimental results demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the proposed CW-Net on a large BM WSI dataset with 16,456 annotated cells of 19 BM cell types and a large-scale WSI dataset for mitotic figure assessment with 262,481 annotated cells of five cell types.",
