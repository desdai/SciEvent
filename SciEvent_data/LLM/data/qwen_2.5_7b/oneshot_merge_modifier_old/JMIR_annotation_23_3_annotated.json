      "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been developing for decades, but in recent years its use in the field of health care has experienced an exponential increase. Currently, there is little doubt that these tools have transformed clinical practice. Therefore, it is important to know how the population perceives its implementation to be able to propose strategies for acceptance and implementation and to improve or prevent problems arising from future applications. This study aims to describe the population’s perception and knowledge of the use of AI as a health support tool and its application to radiology through a validated questionnaire, in order to develop strategies aimed at increasing acceptance of AI use, reducing possible resistance to change, and identifying possible sociodemographic factors related to perception and knowledge. A cross-sectional observational study was conducted using an anonymous and voluntary validated questionnaire aimed at the entire population of Catalonia aged 18 years or older. The survey addresses 4 dimensions defined to describe users’ perception of the use of AI in radiology, (1) 'distrust and accountability,' (2) 'personal interaction,' (3) 'efficiency,' and (4) 'being informed,' all with questions in a Likert scale format. Results closer to 5 refer to a negative perception of the use of AI, while results closer to 1 express a positive perception. Univariate and bivariate analyses were performed to assess possible associations between the 4 dimensions and sociodemographic characteristics. A total of 379 users responded to the survey, with an average age of 43.9 (SD 17.52) years and 59.8% (n=226) of them identified as female. In addition, 89.8% (n=335) of respondents indicated that they understood the concept of AI. Of the 4 dimensions analyzed, 'distrust and accountability' obtained a mean score of 3.37 (SD 0.53), 'personal interaction' obtained a mean score of 4.37 (SD 0.60), 'efficiency' obtained a mean score of 3.06 (SD 0.73), and 'being informed' obtained a mean score of 3.67 (SD 0.57). In relation to the 'distrust and accountability' dimension, women, people older than 65 years, the group with university studies, and the population that indicated not understanding the AI concept had significantly more distrust in the use of AI. On the dimension of 'being informed,' it was observed that the group with university studies rated access to information more positively and those who indicated not understanding the concept of AI rated it more negatively. The majority of the sample investigated reported being familiar with the concept of AI, with varying degrees of acceptance of its implementation in radiology. It is clear that the most conflictive dimension is 'personal interaction,' whereas 'efficiency' is where there is the greatest acceptance, being the dimension in which there are the best expectations for the implementation of AI in radiology.",

Currently, individual users or data aggregators are unable to monetize or contribute such data to wider analytics use cases. When combined with clinical health data, such data can improve the predictive power of data-driven analytics and can proffer many benefits to improve the quality of care. We propose and provide a marketplace mechanism to make these data available while benefiting data providers. We aimed to propose the concept of a decentralized marketplace for patient-generated health data that can improve provenance, data accuracy, security, and privacy. Using a proof-of-concept prototype with an interplanetary file system (IPFS) and Ethereum smart contracts, we aimed to demonstrate decentralized marketplace functionality with the blockchain. We also aimed to illustrate and demonstrate the benefits of such a marketplace. We used a design science research methodology to define and prototype our decentralized marketplace and used the Ethereum blockchain, solidity smart-contract programming language, the web3.js library, and node.js with the MetaMask application to prototype our system. We designed and implemented a prototype of a decentralized health care marketplace catering to health data. We used an IPFS to store data, provide an encryption scheme for the data, and provide smart contracts to communicate with users on the Ethereum blockchain. We met the design goals we set out to accomplish in this study. A decentralized marketplace for trading patient-generated health data can be created using smart-contract technology and IPFS-based data storage. Such a marketplace can improve quality, availability, and provenance and satisfy data privacy, access, auditability, and security needs for such data when compared with centralized systems.",
