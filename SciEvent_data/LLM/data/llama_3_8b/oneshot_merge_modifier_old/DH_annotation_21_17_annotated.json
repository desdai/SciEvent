Visually appealing graphic renderings of data, high classification accuracy and confidence scores, and impressive summary statistics can be rhetorically structured to appeal to preconceived notions and commonplace understandings. While making arguments from the summary of significant features might be permissible in some applications of what is now commonly called data science, humanistic uses of computation put forward in the service of academic arguments require much greater access to and grounding in interpretable digital objects. When features are derived from text, these underlying features need to be shown and interpreted.
