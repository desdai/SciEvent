      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being deployed in high-stakes domains, such as disaster relief and radiology, to aid practitioners during the decision-making process. Explainable AI techniques have been developed and deployed to provide users insights into why the AI made certain predictions. However, recent research suggests that these techniques may confuse or mislead users. We conducted a series of two studies to uncover strategies that humans use to explain decisions and then understand how those explanation strategies impact visual decision-making. In our first study, we elicit explanations from humans when assessing and localizing damaged buildings after natural disasters from satellite imagery and identify four core explanation strategies that humans employed. We then follow up by studying the impact of these explanation strategies by framing the explanations from Study 1 as if they were generated by AI and showing them to a different set of decision-makers performing the same task. We provide initial insights on how causal explanation strategies improve humans' accuracy and calibrate humans' reliance on AI when the AI is incorrect. However, we also find that causal explanation strategies may lead to incorrect rationalizations when AI presents a correct assessment with incorrect localization. We explore the implications of our findings for the design of human-centered explainable AI and address directions for future work.",

Here, we conducted an experiment with 120 participants to test if untrustworthy AI can deceive end-users to gain their trust. Participants interacted with two AI-based chess engines, trustworthy (competent, fair) and untrustworthy (incompetent, unfair), that coached participants by suggesting chess moves in three games against another engine opponent. We varied coaches' transparency about their competence (with the untrustworthy one always exaggerating its competence). We quantified and objectively measured participants' trust based on how often participants relied on coaches' move recommendations. Participants showed inability to assess AI competence by misplacing their trust with the untrustworthy AI, confirming its ability to deceive.
