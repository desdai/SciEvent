      "abstract": "Thanks to easy-to-use data analysis tools and digital infrastructures, even those humanities scholars who lack programming skills can work with large-scale empirical datasets in order to disclose patterns and correlations within them. Although empirical research trends have existed throughout the history of the humanities [Bod 2013], these recently emergent possibilities have revived an empiricist attitude among humanities scholars schooled in more critical and interpretive traditions. Replying to calls for a critical digital humanities [Berry and Fagerjord 2017] [Dobson 2019], this paper explores “tool criticism” [Van Es et al. 2018] - a critical attitude required of digital humanities scholars when working with computational tools and digital infrastructures. First, it explores tool criticism as a response to instrumentalism in the digital humanities and proposes it to be part of what a critical digital humanities does. Second, it analyses tool criticism as practice, in practice. Concretely, it discusses two critical making-inspired workshops in which participants explored the affordances of digital tools and infrastructures and their underlying assumptions and values. The first workshop focused on “games-as-tools” [Werning 2020]. Participants in the workshop engaged with the constraints, material and mechanical, of a card game by making modifications to it. In the second workshop, drawing on the concept of “digital infrapuncture” [Verhoeven 2016], participants examined digital infrastructure in terms of capacity and care. After first identifying “hurt” in a chat environment, they then designed bots to intervene in that hurt and offer relief.",
