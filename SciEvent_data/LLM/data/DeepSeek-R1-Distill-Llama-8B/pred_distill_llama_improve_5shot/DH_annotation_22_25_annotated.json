      "abstract": "Syuzhet is a dictionary-based tool for the sentiment analysis of literary texts that draws upon the Syuzhet, Bing, Afinn, and NRC lexicons. Syuzhet is a work in progress with the potential to become an invaluable tool for the sentiment analysis of literary texts. However, there have been doubts about sentiment analysis in the digital humanities field, especially after Swafford’s impactful critique of Syuzhet. Since it is impossible to achieve 100% accuracy in sentiment analysis, we should embrace the imperfection and continue to use Syuzhet while also making efforts to fully understand its limits and abilities. In addition, we should continuously provide feedback for the tool, since the duty of improving digital tools belongs to all digital humanists who employ digital tools. This article explores the limits of and improvements made upon Syuzhet by examining and testing its code and functions with 19th century British novels; the subjectivity of its lexicons; and the validity of Swafford’s critique.",
