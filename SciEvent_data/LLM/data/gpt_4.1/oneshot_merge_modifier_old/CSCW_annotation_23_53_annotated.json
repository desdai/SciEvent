      "abstract": "The question of how to develop and maintain appropriate, socially informed and sophisticated infrastructural systems is an ongoing concern for CSCW. Information infrastructure development efforts are usually large endeavors that involve many stakeholders, including several organizations that need to interoperate with legacy systems. Projects typically take several years to develop. The duration, variety, and sites of engagement in the development of information infrastructures can be challenging to approach with typical CSCW approaches. In this paper, we compare and analyze our varied experiences in order to generate lessons learned based on being embedded for three or more years as action researchers and ethnographers in infrastructure development projects in the domains of traffic engineering, vocational education, and ocean science. Drawing upon these experiences, as well as literature in infrastructure studies, design methodologies, and organizational studies, we extract guidance for researchers and practitioners seeking to understand and engage in long-term organizationally complex system development projects. Among these lessons, we encourage revisiting previously gathered data as scope and scale change, observing changes in the discursive 'reference public' who will benefit from the system, and planning for different intellectual points of entry and exit. This paper lays groundwork for future developments in theory and method of collaborative design and development in and with complex systems.",

However, it is unclear (1) how end users perceive the choices and affordances of different kinds of personal content moderation tools, and (2) how the introduction of personalization impacts user perceptions of platforms' content moderation responsibilities. This paper investigates end users' perspectives on personal content moderation tools by conducting an interview study with a diverse sample of 24 active social media users. We probe interviewees' preferences using simulated personal moderation interfaces, including word filters, sliders for toxicity levels, and boolean toxicity toggles. We also examine the labor involved for users in choosing moderation settings and present users' attitudes about the roles and responsibilities of social media platforms and other stakeholders toward moderation. We discuss how our findings can inform design solutions to improve transparency and controllability in personal content moderation tools.",
