      "abstract": "Charles Stewart Parnell was one of the most controversial and effective leaders in the United Kingdom in the second half of the nineteenth century. Almost single-handedly, he transformed the proposal of Home Rule for Ireland from a languishing irrelevance to a mass-supported cause. Though the historiography on Parnell is substantial, his speeches - the main primary sources for accessing both his thinking and strategies - have never been collected or edited. One of the core questions in working towards an edition of his speeches was whether it would be possible to use automated methods on these fragmentary sources to reconstruct what Parnell actually said in them. We were also interested in how the reports varied, and what that variation might tell us about the practices and biases of the journalists who wrote them and the newspapers which published them. This article discusses the use of two digital tools in our attempts to answer these research questions: CollateX, which was designed by Digital Humanities practitioners for the comparison of textual variants, and SBERT Sentence Transformers, which establishes levels of similarity between texts. In this article we talk about how the application of digital methods to the corpus led us away from the idea of producing definitive reconstructions of the speeches, and towards a deeper understanding of the corpus and the journalistic practices which went into its creation.",
