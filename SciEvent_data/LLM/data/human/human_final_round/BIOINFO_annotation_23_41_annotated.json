For example, only 0.25% of all entries of UniProtKB are reviewed by human annotators. Further developing automatic tools to infer protein function from sequence alone can alleviate part of this gap. In this article, we investigate the potential of Transformer deep neural networks on a specific case of functional sequence annotation: the prediction of enzymatic classes. We show that our EnzBert transformer models, trained to predict Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers by specialization of a protein language model, outperforms state-of-the-art tools for monofunctional enzyme class prediction based on sequences only. Accuracy is improved from 84% to 95% on the prediction of EC numbers at level two on the EC40 benchmark. To evaluate the prediction quality at level four, the most detailed level of EC numbers, we built two new time-based benchmarks for comparison with state-of-the-art methods ECPred and DeepEC: the macro-F1 score is respectively improved from 41% to 54% and from 20% to 26%. Finally, we also show that using a simple combination of attention maps is on par with, or better than, other classical interpretability methods on the EC prediction task. More specifically, important residues identified by attention maps tend to correspond to known catalytic sites. Quantitatively, we report a max F-Gain score of 96.05%, while classical interpretability methods reach 91.44% at best.",
