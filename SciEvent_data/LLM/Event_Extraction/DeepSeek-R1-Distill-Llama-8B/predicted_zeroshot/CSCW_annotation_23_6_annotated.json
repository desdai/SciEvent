      "abstract": "Youth regularly use technology driven by artificial intelligence (AI). However, it is increasingly well-known that AI can cause harm on small and large scales, especially for those underrepresented in tech fields. Recently, users have played active roles in surfacing and mitigating harm from algorithmic bias. Despite being frequent users of AI, youth have been under-explored as potential contributors and stakeholders to the future of AI. We consider three notions that may be at the root of youth facing barriers to playing an active role in responsible AI, which are youth (1) cannot understand the technical aspects of AI, (2) cannot understand the ethical issues around AI, and (3) need protection from serious topics related to bias and injustice. In this study, we worked with youth (N = 30) in first through twelfth grade and parents (N = 6) to explore how youth can be part of identifying algorithmic bias and designing future systems to address problematic technology behavior. We found that youth are capable of identifying and articulating algorithmic bias, often in great detail. Participants suggested different ways users could give feedback for AI that reflects their values of diversity and inclusion. Youth who may have less experience with computing or exposure to societal structures can be supported by peers or adults with more of this knowledge, leading to critical conversations about fairer AI. This work illustrates youths' insights, suggesting that they should be integrated in building a future of responsible AI.",

Starting a new life can be unsettling for refugees and asylum seekers during the resettling process in their host countries, particularly when it comes to gaining financial independence. This paper used an interview-based study to engage with fifteen refugees and asylum seekers to learn how they achieve entrepreneurial success as they navigate refugee specific barriers in a new economy. The insights showed refugee entrepreneur specific barriers that align with resettlement challenges and the technical and social resourcefulness of this under-resourced community. Our contributions to the CSCW research community are an understanding of how low-socioeconomic entrepreneurs such as refugees, function in their ecosystem and design implications for developing technology to further the efforts of refugee entrepreneurs.",
