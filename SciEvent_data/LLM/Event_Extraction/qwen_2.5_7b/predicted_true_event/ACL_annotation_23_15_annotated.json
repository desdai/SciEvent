      "abstract": "Spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks have been studied for many decades in the speech research community, but have not received as much attention as lower-level tasks like speech and speaker recognition. In this work, we introduce several new annotated SLU benchmark tasks based on freely available speech data, which complement existing benchmarks and address gaps in the SLU evaluation landscape. We contribute four tasks: question answering and summarization involve inference over longer speech sequences; named entity localization addresses the speech-specific task of locating the targeted content in the signal; dialog act classification identifies the function of a given speech utterance. In order to facilitate the development of SLU models that leverage the success of pre-trained speech representations, we will release a new benchmark suite, including for each task (i) curated annotations for a relatively small fine-tuning set, (ii) reproducible pipeline (speech recognizer + text model) and end-to-end baseline models and evaluation metrics, (iii) baseline model performance in various types of systems for easy comparisons. We present the details of data collection and annotation and the performance of the baseline models. We also analyze the sensitivity of pipeline models’ performance to the speech recognition accuracy, using more than 20 publicly available speech recognition models.",
