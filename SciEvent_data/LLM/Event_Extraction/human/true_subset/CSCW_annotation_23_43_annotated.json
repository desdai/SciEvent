      "abstract": "How can online communities execute a focused vision for their space? Curation offers one approach, where community leaders manually select content to share with the community. Curation enables leaders to shape a space that matches their taste, norms, and values, but the practice is often intractable at social media scale: curators cannot realistically sift through hundreds or thousands of submissions daily. In this paper, we contribute algorithmic and interface foundations enabling curation at scale, and manifest these foundations in a system called Cura. Our approach draws on the observation that, while curators' attention is limited, other community members' upvotes are plentiful and informative of curators' likely opinions. We thus contribute a transformer-based curation model that predicts whether each curator will upvote a post based on previous community upvotes. Cura applies this curation model to create a feed of content that it predicts the curator would want in the community. Evaluations demonstrate that the curation model accurately estimates opinions of diverse curators, that changing curators for a community results in clearly recognizable shifts in the community's content, and that, consequently, curation can reduce anti-social behavior by half without extra moderation effort. By sampling different types of curators, Cura lowers the threshold to genres of curated social media ranging from editorial groups to stakeholder roundtables to democracies.",
