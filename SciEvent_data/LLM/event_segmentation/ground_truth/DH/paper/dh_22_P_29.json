    "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to introduce Linked data from TEI (LIFT), an open-source tool written as a set of Python scripts for generating linked data from TEI-encoded texts. LIFT’s goal is to walk users through the transformation process from TEI to linked data step by step, as well as to promote a better understanding of the theoretical and methodological aspects that underpin the transformation. LIFT was created in the context of the University of Bologna’s Master Degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge as a teaching tool for students encountering linked open data for the first time as a method of organizing and publishing cultural knowledge and, specifically, digital scholarly editions on the web in a perspective of data integration.",
