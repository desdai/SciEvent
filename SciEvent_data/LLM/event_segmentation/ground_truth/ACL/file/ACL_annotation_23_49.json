    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models have enabled them to perform well on complex tasks that require step-by-step reasoning with few-shot learning. However, it is unclear whether these models are applying reasoning skills they have learned during pre-training, or if they are simply memorizing their training corpus at finer granularity and have learned to better understand their context. To address this question, we introduce ALERT, a benchmark and suite of analyses for evaluating reasoning skills of language models. ALERT enables comparing pre-trained and finetuned models on complex tasks that require reasoning skills to solve them. Our benchmark provides a test bed to assess any language model on fine-grained reasoning skills, which spans over 20 datasets and covers 10 different reasoning skills. To prove the efficacy of ALERT we investigate the role of finetuning. Our extensive empirical analysis shows that language models acquire reasoning skills such as textual entailment, abductive reasoning, and analogical reasoning during the finetuning stage compared to the pretraining stage. Another finding is that when language models are finetuned, they tend to overfit to the prompt template, which hurts the robustness of models, resulting in generalization problems.",

    "abstract": "Implicit discourse relation classification is a challenging task due to the absence of discourse connectives. To overcome this issue, we design an end-to-end neural model to explicitly generate discourse connectives for the task, inspired by the annotation process of PDTB. Specifically, our model jointly learns to generate discourse connectives between arguments and predict discourse relations based on the arguments and the generated connectives. To prevent our relation classifier from being misled by poor connectives generated at the early stage of training while alleviating the discrepancy between training and inference, we adopt Scheduled Sampling to the joint learning. We evaluate our method on three benchmarks, PDTB 2.0, PDTB 3.0, and PCC. Results show that our joint model significantly outperforms various baselines on three datasets, demonstrating its superiority for the task.",
