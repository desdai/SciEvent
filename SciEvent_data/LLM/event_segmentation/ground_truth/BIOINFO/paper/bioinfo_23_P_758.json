    "abstract": "Phecodes are widely used and easily adapted phenotypes based on International Classification of Diseases codes. The current version of phecodes (v1.2) was designed primarily to study common/complex diseases diagnosed in adults; however, there are numerous limitations in the codes and their structure. Here, we present phecodeX, an expanded version of phecodes with a revised structure and 1,761 new codes. PhecodeX adds granularity to phenotypes in key disease domains that are under-represented in the current phecode structure — including infectious disease, pregnancy, congenital anomalies, and neonatology — and is a more robust representation of the medical phenome for global use in discovery research.",
