    "abstract": "Extracellular particles (EPs) are the focus of a rapidly growing area of exploration due to the widespread interest in understanding their roles in health and disease. However, despite the general need for EP data sharing and established community standards for data reporting, no standard repository for EP flow cytometry data captures rigor and minimum reporting standards such as those defined by MIFlowCyt-EV (https://doi.org/10.1080/20013078.2020.1713526). We sought to address this unmet need by developing the NanoFlow Repository. We have developed The NanoFlow Repository to provide the first implementation of the MIFlowCyt-EV framework.",
