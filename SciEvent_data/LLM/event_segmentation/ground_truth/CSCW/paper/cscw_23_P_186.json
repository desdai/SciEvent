    "abstract": "While aging adults frequently prefer to 'age in place', their children can worry about their well-being, especially when they live at a distance. Many in-home systems are designed to monitor the real-time status of seniors at home and provide information to their adult children. However, we observed that the needs and concerns of both sides in the information sharing process are often not aligned. In this research, we examined the design of a system that mitigates the privacy needs of aging adults in light of the information desires of adult children. We apply an iterative process to design and evaluate a visualization of indoor location data and compare its benefits to displaying raw video from cameras. We elaborate on the tradeoffs surrounding privacy and awareness made by older adults and their children, and synthesize design criteria for designing a visualization system to manage these tensions and tradeoffs.",
