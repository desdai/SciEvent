    "abstract": "Video recordings of patients may offer advantages to supplement patient assessment and clinical decision-making. However, little is known about the practice of video recording patients for direct care purposes. We aimed to synthesize empirical studies published internationally to explore the extent to which video recording patients is acceptable and effective in supporting direct care and, for the United Kingdom, to summarize the relevant guidance of professional and regulatory bodies. Five electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, APA PsycINFO, CENTRAL, and HMIC) were searched from 2012 to 2022. Eligible studies evaluated an intervention involving video recording of adult patients (≥18 years) to support diagnosis, care, or treatment. All study designs and countries of publication were included. Websites of UK professional and regulatory bodies were searched to identify relevant guidance. The acceptability of video recording patients was evaluated using study recruitment and retention rates and a framework synthesis of patients’ and clinical staff’s perspectives based on the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability by Sekhon. Clinically relevant measures of impact were extracted and tabulated according to the study design. The framework approach was used to synthesize the reported ethico-legal considerations, and recommendations of professional and regulatory bodies were extracted and tabulated. Of the 14,221 abstracts screened, 27 studies met the inclusion criteria. Overall, 13 guidance documents were retrieved, of which 7 were retained for review. The views of patients and clinical staff (16 studies) were predominantly positive, although concerns were expressed about privacy, technical considerations, and integrating video recording into clinical workflows; some patients were anxious about their physical appearance. The mean recruitment rate was 68.2% (SD 22.5%; range 34.2%-100%; 12 studies), and the mean retention rate was 73.3% (SD 28.6%; range 16.7%-100%; 17 studies). Regarding effectiveness (10 studies), patients and clinical staff considered video recordings to be valuable in supporting assessment, care, and treatment; in promoting patient engagement; and in enhancing communication and recall of information. Observational studies (n=5) favored video recording, but randomized controlled trials (n=5) did not demonstrate that video recording was superior to the controls. UK guidelines are consistent in their recommendations around consent, privacy, and storage of recordings but lack detailed guidance on how to operationalize these recommendations in clinical practice. Video recording patients for direct care purposes appears to be acceptable, despite concerns about privacy, technical considerations, and how to incorporate recording into clinical workflows. Methodological quality prevents firm conclusions from being drawn; therefore, pragmatic trials (particularly in older adult care and the movement disorders field) should evaluate the impact of video recording on diagnosis, treatment monitoring, patient-clinician communication, and patient safety. Professional and regulatory documents should signpost to practical guidance on the implementation of video recording in routine practice.",

    "abstract": "The urban-rural disparities in health outcomes in China are remarkable. The internet has shown the potential to reduce the likelihood of contracting a disease by increasing disease knowledge. However, little is known about the effects of internet use in alleviating health inequities between urban and rural areas. This study aimed to examine the mediation and moderation of health disparities between urban and rural older adults through internet use. A total of 8223 respondents were selected from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study 2018 data set. Basic activities of daily living, a brief Community Screening Instrument for Dementia, and the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale were used to measure functional disability, cognitive function, and depressive symptoms, respectively. Logistic regressions testing “internet use×urban-rural status” interactions for moderation and Karlson-Holm-Breen decomposition for mediation were performed. Internet use moderated the urban-rural disparities in cognitive function (odds ratio 7.327, 95% CI 3.011-17.832) and depressive symptoms (odds ratio 1.070, 95% CI 1.037-1.787), but the moderating effects were significant only for those using the internet daily. Karlson-Holm-Breen results showed the suppression effects of using the internet daily (β=.012, 95% CI .002-.021) on the association between urban-rural status and cognitive function. The urban-rural inequality in depressive symptoms was partially attributed to the disparity in internet use (β=−.027, 95% CI −.043 to −.009). The urban-rural inequalities in mental health are partially attributable to disparities in the prevalence of internet use between the 2 groups. However, using the internet is more beneficial for the psychological health of rural users, thereby alleviating the urban-rural disparities in health. Providing convenient channels for rural older adults to use the internet, improving the ability of rural users to effectively use the internet, and promoting internet popularity in rural areas are effective approaches to reducing urban-rural health inequalities.",
