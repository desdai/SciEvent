    "abstract": "Mass gatherings (MGs; e.g., religious, sporting, musical, sociocultural, and other occasions that draw large crowds) pose public health challenges and concerns related to global health. A leading global concern regarding MGs is the possible importation and exportation of infectious diseases as they spread from the attendees to the general population, resulting in epidemic outbreaks. Governments and health authorities use technological interventions to support public health surveillance and prevent and control infectious diseases. This study aims to review the evidence on the effectiveness of public health digital surveillance systems for infectious disease prevention and control at MG events. A systematic literature search was conducted in January 2022 using the Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Scopus databases to examine relevant articles published in English up to January 2022. Interventional studies describing or evaluating the effectiveness of public health digital surveillance systems for infectious disease prevention and control at MGs were included in the analysis. Owing to the lack of appraisal tools for interventional studies describing and evaluating public health digital surveillance systems at MGs, a critical appraisal tool was developed and used to assess the quality of the included studies. In total, 8 articles were included in the review, and 3 types of MGs were identified: religious (the Hajj and Prayagraj Kumbh), sporting (the Olympic and Paralympic Games, the Federation International Football Association World Cup, and the Micronesian Games), and cultural (the Festival of Pacific Arts) events. In total, 88% (7/8) of the studies described surveillance systems implemented at MG events, and 12% (1/8) of the studies described and evaluated an enhanced surveillance system that was implemented for an event. In total, 4 studies reported the implementation of a surveillance system: 2 (50%) described the enhancement of the system that was implemented for an event, 1 (25%) reported a pilot implementation of a surveillance system, and 1 (25%) reported an evaluation of an enhanced system. The types of systems investigated were 2 syndromic, 1 participatory, 1 syndromic and event-based, 1 indicator- and event-based, and 1 event-based surveillance system. In total, 62% (5/8) of the studies reported timeliness as an outcome generated after implementing or enhancing the system without measuring its effectiveness. Only 12% (1/8) of the studies followed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems and the outcomes of enhanced systems based on the systems’ attributes to measure their effectiveness. On the basis of the review of the literature and the analysis of the included studies, there is limited evidence of the effectiveness of public health digital surveillance systems for infectious disease prevention and control at MGs because of the absence of evaluation studies.",

    "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders are associated with cognitive impairment. We have developed a web-based, 9-task cognitive battery to measure the core domains affected in people with psychiatric disorders. To date, this assessment has been used to collect data on a clinical sample of participants with psychiatric disorders. The aims of this study were (1) to establish a briefer version of the battery (called the Cardiff Online Cognitive Assessment [CONCA]) that can give a valid measure of cognitive ability (“g”) and (2) to collect normative data and demonstrate CONCA’s application in a health population sample. Based on 6 criteria and data from our previous study, we selected 5 out of the original 9 tasks to include in CONCA. These included 3 core tasks that were sufficient to derive a measure of “g” and 2 optional tasks. Participants from a web-based national cohort study (HealthWise Wales) were invited to complete CONCA. Completion rates, sample characteristics, performance distributions, and associations between cognitive performance and demographic characteristics and mental health measures were examined. A total of 3679 participants completed at least one CONCA task, of which 3135 completed all 3 core CONCA tasks. Performance on CONCA was associated with age (B=–0.05, SE 0.002; P<.001), device (tablet computer: B=–0.26, SE 0.05; P<.001; smartphone: B=–0.46, SE 0.05; P<.001), education (degree: B=1.68, SE 0.14; P<.001), depression symptoms (B=–0.04, SE 0.01; P<.001), and anxiety symptoms (B=–0.04, SE 0.01; P<.001). CONCA provides a valid measure of “g,” which can be derived using as few as 3 tasks that take no more than 15 minutes. Performance on CONCA showed associations with demographic characteristics in the expected direction and was associated with current depression and anxiety symptoms. The effect of device on cognitive performance is an important consideration for research using web-based assessments.",
