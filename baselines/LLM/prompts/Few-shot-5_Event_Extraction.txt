You are an expert argument annotator. Given a part of a scientific abstract, you need to identify the key trigger for the event (the main verb or action that signals an important research activity) and annotate the abstract with the corresponding argument components related to this trigger. Extractions should capture complete phrases around this key trigger and be organized in a single JSON format, containing only what is explicitly stated in the text without adding any interpretation.

### Abstract Segment to Analyze:

{abstract}

### Argument Components to Extract:

Action: What is the SINGLE most representative trigger (verb or verb phrase) in the segment? 

Agent: Who or what is performing this action? 

Object:
- Primary Object: What is directly receiving or affected by the action? 
- Secondary Object: What is a secondary entity also receiving the action?

Context: What provides foundational or situational information of the event?

Purpose: What is the purpose or aim of the event?

Method: What techniques, tools, approaches, or frameworks are used in the event?

Results: What are the outcomes, observations or findings of the event?

Analysis: What are the interpretations or explanations of other arguments?

Challenge: What are the constraints or weaknesses of the event?

Ethical: What are the ethical concerns, justifications or implications of the event?

Implications: What is the broader significance or potential for future applications/research?

Contradictions: What are the disagreements with existing knowledge?

### Extraction Rules:

1. Extract complete phrases, not just single words.
2. Only extract elements that are explicitly present. Mark missing elements as ["<NONE>"].
3. Use the exact text from the abstract.
4. Break down sentences when different parts fit different arguments.
5. NEVER use the same span of text for multiple arguments - each piece of text must be assigned to exactly one argument type. However, multiple text spans can be part of the same argument (e.g., ["text span 1", "text span 2".....] can be used for a single argument type) if different parts of the text contribute to the same argument.
6. If text could fit multiple arguments, prioritize in this order: Results > Purpose > Method > Analysis > Implication > Challenge > Contradiction > Context > Ethical

Here are comprehensive examples from five academic domains, showing all four event types:

## Example 1: 

Background/Introduction Event
For abstract: "Second language acquisition (SLA) research has extensively studied cross-linguistic transfer, the influence of linguistic structure of a speaker's native language [L1] on the successful acquisition of a foreign language [L2]. Effects of such transfer can be positive (facilitating acquisition) or negative (impeding acquisition). We find that NLP literature has not given enough attention to the phenomenon of negative transfer."

Output:

  "Action": "has extensively studied",
  "Agent": ["Second language acquisition (SLA) research"],
  "Object": {
    "Primary Object": ["cross-linguistic transfer"],

  "Challenge": ["NLP literature has not given enough attention to the phenomenon of negative transfer"],
  "Ethical": ["<NONE>"],
  "Implications": ["<NONE>"],
  "Contradictions": ["<NONE>"]
}

Methods/Approach Event
For abstract: "To understand patterns of both positive and negative transfer between L1 and L2, we model sequential second language acquisition in LMs. Further, we build a Multilingual Age Ordered CHILDES (MAO-CHILDES) — a dataset consisting of 5 typologically diverse languages, i.e., German, French, Polish, Indonesian, and Japanese — to understand the degree to which native Child-Directed Speech (CDS) [L1] can help or conflict with English language acquisition [L2]."

  "Challenge": ["<NONE>"],
  "Ethical": ["<NONE>"],

  "Contradictions": ["<NONE>"]
}

Results/Findings Event
For abstract: "To examine the impact of native CDS, we use the TILT-based cross lingual transfer learning approach established by Papadimitriou and Jurafsky (2020) and find that, as in human SLA, language family distance predicts more negative transfer. Additionally, we find that conversational speech data shows greater facilitation for language acquisition than scripted speech data."

  "Contradictions": ["<NONE>"]
}

## Example 2: 

Background/Introduction Event
For abstract: "Read-overlap-based graph data structures play a central role in computing de novo genome assembly. Most long-read assemblers use Myers's string graph model to sparsify overlap graphs. Graph sparsification improves assembly contiguity by removing spurious and redundant connections. However, a graph model must be coverage-preserving, i.e. it must ensure that there exist walks in the graph that spell all chromosomes, given sufficient sequencing coverage. This property becomes even more important for diploid genomes, polyploid genomes, and metagenomes where there is a risk of losing haplotype-specific information."

Output:
{
  "Action": "play",
  "Agent": ["Read-overlap-based graph data structures"],
  "Object": {
    "Primary Object": ["a central role"],
    "Secondary Object": ["<NONE>"]

  "Ethical": ["<NONE>"],
  "Implications": ["<NONE>"],
  "Contradictions": ["<NONE>"]
}

Methods/Approach Event
For abstract: "We develop a novel theoretical framework under which the coverage-preserving properties of a graph model can be analyzed. We first prove that de Bruijn graph and overlap graph models are guaranteed to be coverage-preserving. We next show that the standard string graph model lacks this guarantee."

Output:

  "Ethical": ["<NONE>"],
  "Implications": ["<NONE>"],
  "Contradictions": ["<NONE>"]
}

Results/Findings Event
For abstract: "The latter result is consistent with prior work suggesting that removal of contained reads, i.e., the reads that are substrings of other reads, can lead to coverage gaps during string graph construction. Our experiments done using simulated long reads from HG002 human diploid genome show that 50 coverage gaps are introduced on average by ignoring contained reads from nanopore datasets."

Output:
{
  "Action": "show",

  "Contradictions": ["<NONE>"]
}

Conclusions/Implications Event
For abstract: "To remedy this, we propose practical heuristics that are well-supported by our theoretical results and are useful to decide which contained reads should be retained to avoid coverage gaps. Our method retains a small fraction of contained reads (1-2%) and closes majority of the coverage gaps."

Output:

## Example 3: 

Background/Introduction Event
For abstract: "Live streaming has become a popular activity world-wide that has warranted research attention on its privacy related issues. For instance, bystanders' privacy, or the privacy of third-parties captured by streamers, has been increasingly studied as live streaming has become almost ubiquitous in both public and private spaces in many countries. While prior work has studied bystanders' privacy concerns, a gap exists in understanding how streamers consider bystanders' privacy and the steps they take (or do not take) to preserve it. Understanding streamers' considerations towards bystanders' privacy is vital because streamers are the ones who have direct control over whether and how bystanders' information is disclosed."

Output:
{
  "Action": "has become",
  "Agent": ["Live streaming"],
  "Object": {
    "Primary Object": ["a popular activity world-wide"],

  "Implications": ["<NONE>"],
  "Contradictions": ["<NONE>"]
}

Results/Findings Event
For abstract: "We found that streamers cared about bystanders' privacy and evaluated possible privacy violations to bystanders from several perspectives. To protect bystanders from privacy violations, streamers primarily relied on technical, behavioral, and collaborative strategies. Our results also indicated that current streaming platforms lacked features that helped streamers seamlessly manage bystanders' privacy and involved bystanders into their privacy decision-making."

The inclusion criteria were established according to the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and study (PICOS) design framework: children aged <18 years diagnosed with OBP, VR therapy used in addition to conventional therapy or isolated, VR therapy compared with conventional therapy, outcomes related to OBP rehabilitation therapy, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The PEDro scale was used to assess the methodological quality of the RCTs, and the Cochrane Collaboration tool was used to assess the risk of bias.

Nevertheless, scientific literature supports the use of VR technologies for rehabilitation as it provides several advantages, such as enhancing the patient's motivation, providing direct feedback, and focusing the patient's attention during the intervention. Thus, the use of VR for upper limb rehabilitation in patients with OBP is still in its first stages. Small sample sizes; limited long-term analysis; lack of testing of different doses; and absence of International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health–related outcomes were present in the included RCTs, so further research is needed to fully understand the potential of VR technologies as a therapeutic approach for patients with OBP."
