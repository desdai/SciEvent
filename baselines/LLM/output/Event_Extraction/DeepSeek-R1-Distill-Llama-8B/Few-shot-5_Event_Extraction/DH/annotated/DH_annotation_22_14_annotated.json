      "abstract": "Network representation is a crucial topic in historical social network analysis. The debate around their value and connotations, led by humanist scholars, is today more relevant than ever, seeing how common these representations are as support for historical analysis. Force-directed networks, in particular, are popular as they can be developed relatively quickly, and reveal patterns and structures in data. The underlying algorithms, although powerful in revealing hidden patterns, do not retain meaningful structure and existing hierarchies within historical social networks. In this article, we question the foreign aspect of this structure that force-directed layouts create in historical datasets. We explore the importance of hierarchy in social networks, and investigate whether hierarchies - strongly present within our models of social structure - affect our perception of social network data. Results from our user evaluation indicate that hierarchical network representations reduce cognitive load and lead to more frequent and deeper insights into historical social networks. We also find that users report a preference for the hierarchical graph representation. We analyse these findings in light of the broader discussion on the value of force-directed network representations within humanistic research, and introduce open questions for future work in this line of research.",
