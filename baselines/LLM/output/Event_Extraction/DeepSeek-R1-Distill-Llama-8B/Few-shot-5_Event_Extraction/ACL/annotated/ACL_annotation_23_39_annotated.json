Because we want to avoid missing out on opportunities or making fruitless actions after those entities have disappeared, it is important to know when entities disappear as early as possible. We thus tackle the task of detecting disappearing entities from microblogs where various information is shared timely. The major challenge is detecting uncertain contexts of disappearing entities from noisy microblog posts. To collect such disappearing contexts, we design time-sensitive distant supervision, which utilizes entities from the knowledge base and time-series posts. Using this method, we actually build large-scale Twitter datasets of disappearing entities. To ensure robust detection in noisy environments, we refine pretrained word embeddings for the detection model on microblog streams in a timely manner. Experimental results on the Twitter datasets confirmed the effectiveness of the collected labeled data and refined word embeddings; the proposed method outperformed a baseline in terms of accuracy, and more than 70% of the detected disappearing entities in Wikipedia are discovered earlier than the update on Wikipedia, with the average lead-time over one month.",

However, current WVLP methods use only local descriptions of images, i.e., object tags, as cross-modal anchors to construct weakly-aligned image-text pairs for pre-training. This affects the data quality and thus the effectiveness of pre-training. In this paper, we propose to directly take a small number of aligned image-text pairs as anchors, and represent each unaligned image and text by its similarities to these anchors, i.e., relative representations. We build a WVLP framework based on the relative representations, namely RELIT, which collects high-quality weakly-aligned image-text pairs from large-scale image-only and text-only data for pre-training through relative representation-based retrieval and generation. Experiments on four downstream tasks show that RELIT achieves new state-of-the-art results under the weakly supervised setting.",
