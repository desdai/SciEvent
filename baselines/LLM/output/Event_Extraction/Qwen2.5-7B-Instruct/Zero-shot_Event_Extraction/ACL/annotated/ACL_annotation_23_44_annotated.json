The common practice in implementing dynamic networks is to convert the given static layers into fully dynamic ones where all parameters are dynamic (at least within a single layer) and vary with the input. However, such a fully dynamic setting may cause redundant parameters and high deployment costs, limiting the applicability of dynamic networks to a broader range of tasks and models. The main contributions of our work are challenging the basic commonsense in dynamic networks and proposing a partially dynamic network, namely PAD-Net, to transform the redundant dynamic parameters into static ones. Also, we further design Iterative Mode Partition to partition dynamic and static parameters efficiently. Our method is comprehensively supported by large-scale experiments with two typical advanced dynamic architectures, i.e., DY-Conv and MoE, on both image classification and GLUE benchmarks. Encouragingly, we surpass the fully dynamic networks by +0.7% top-1 acc with only 30% dynamic parameters for ResNet-50 and +1.9% average score in language understanding with only 50% dynamic parameters for BERT.",

We propose ACCENT, an event commonsense evaluation metric empowered by commonsense knowledge bases (CSKBs).
