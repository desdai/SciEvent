    "abstract": "Learners' awareness of their own affective states (emotions) can improve their meta-cognition, which is a critical skill of being aware of and controlling one's cognitive, motivational, and affect, and adjusting their learning strategies and behaviors accordingly. To investigate the effect of peers' affects on learners' meta-cognition, we proposed two types of cues that aggregated peers' affects that were recognized via facial expression recognition: Locative cues (displaying the spikes of peers' emotions along a video timeline) and Temporal cues (showing the positivities of peers' emotions at different segments of a video). We conducted a between-subject experiment with 42 college students through the use of think-aloud protocols, interviews, and surveys. Our results showed that the two types of cues improved participants' meta-cognition differently. For example, interacting with the Temporal cues triggered the participants to compare their own affective responses with their peers and reflect more on why and how they had different emotions with the same video content. While the participants perceived the benefits of using AI-generated peers' cues to improve their awareness of their own learning affects, they also sought more explanations from their peers to understand the AI-generated results. Our findings not only provide novel design implications for promoting learners' meta-cognition with privacy-preserved social cues of peers' learning affects, but also suggest an expanded design framework for Explainable AI (XAI).",

    "abstract": "This paper extends the literature on social media activism by foregrounding the invisible work of orchestrating it. We analyze the activities of a #MeToo group in a Northern European country and characterize the group's efforts to catalog incidents of gender-based harassment and discrimination as an activist, platform-mediated participatory writing project. Our analysis details the work of organizing this form of activism, particularly: 1) the editorial work that underlies publishing personal stories on social media, 2) the emotional labor that unfolds as part of this form of writing, and 3) the work of creating publics. By drawing attention to these efforts, the paper frames activism as effortfully driven, sometimes in tension with the platform or evolving value positions. We conclude with a discussion on the role of social networking sites in organizing activism where writing is central, and with a set of sensitivities that can support designers and activists alike in designing socio-technical practices concerned with social change.",

Do not add any additional information outside what is given in the abstract. Summary: The abstract suggests that there should be increased consideration of the invisible yet crucial aspects of social media activism such as organizational tasks like editing and creating publics. It also implies that both designers and activists need to take into account the emotional labor involved when crafting socio-technical solutions aimed at promoting social change through platforms like social networks. Additionally, understanding how to effectively utilize these platforms requires sensitivity towards the dynamics between users' value positions and those offered by the platforms themselves. These insights could guide better design strategies moving forward. <|END_OF_RESPONSE|> Summary: Both designers and activists need to consider the invisible work of organizing social media activism, including editing, creating publics, and managing emotional labor. Understanding the dynamics between user value positions and platform offerings is essential. These considerations can inform more effective socio-technical designs for social change. <|END_OF_RESPONSE|>"
