    "abstract": "The spread of misinformation on social media is a pressing societal problem that platforms, policymakers, and researchers continue to grapple with. As a countermeasure, recent works have proposed to employ non-expert fact-checkers in the crowd to fact-check social media content. While experimental studies suggest that crowds might be able to accurately assess the veracity of social media content, an understanding of how crowd fact-checked (mis-)information spreads is missing. In this work, we empirically analyze the spread of misleading vs. not misleading community fact-checked posts on social media. For this purpose, we employ a dataset of community-created fact-checks from Twitter's 'Birdwatch' pilot and map them to resharing cascades on Twitter. Different from earlier studies analyzing the spread of misinformation listed on third-party fact-checking websites (e.g., snopes.com), we find that community fact-checked misinformation is less viral. Specifically, misleading posts are estimated to receive 36.62% fewer retweets than not misleading posts. A partial explanation may lie in differences in the fact-checking targets: community fact-checkers tend to fact-check posts from influential user accounts with many followers, while expert fact-checks tend to target posts that are shared by less influential users. We further find that there are significant differences in virality across different sub-types of misinformation (e.g., factual errors, missing context, manipulated media). Moreover, we conduct a user study to assess the perceived reliability of (real-world) community-created fact-checks. Here, we find that users, to a large extent, agree with community-created fact-checks. Altogether, our findings offer insights into how misleading vs. not misleading posts spread and highlight the crucial role of sample selection when studying misinformation on social media.",

Based on the provided data, does it seem more effective for certain types of misinformation? Given the constraints, I cannot provide any additional analysis or inference beyond what is explicitly stated in the abstract. Therefore: <NONE> According to the results mentioned: <EXACT TEXT or <NONE>> There are significant differences in virality across different sub-types of misinformation (e.g., factual errors, missing context, manipulated media). <EXACT TEXT or <NONE>> Specifically, misleading posts are estimated to receive 36.62% fewer retweets than not misleading posts. This suggests some level of effectiveness but indicates variability depending on the type of misinformation. However, direct comparisons between community-based fact-checking and other methods were not made in the given excerpt. Thus, based solely on the provided information, no definitive conclusions about comparative effectiveness can be drawn. <NONE> Please note that the exact phrasing needed was already provided directly within the Results section without needing rephrasing as per instructions. Any inferred statements would exceed those guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the values that collaborators bring to a collaboration is important for the design of new systems. In collaborative systems, understanding differing values could help design solutions to mitigate conflicts and more effectively coordinate collaboration. We review prior studies of Commons-Based Peer Production (CBPP) identifying four common value dimensions previously noted as present in CBPP: usage value, social value, ideological value, and monetary value. We use this synthetic framework to analyze a dataset of 32 interviews with contributors to Wikimedia Commons and editors of Wikipedia who use Commons resources. Our analysis supports the prior values categories while expanding how some dimensions are expressed by participants. We also highlight four additional value dimensions that were not previously identified in CBPP: cultural heritage value, rarity value, aesthetic value, and administrative value. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of collaborative systems.",
