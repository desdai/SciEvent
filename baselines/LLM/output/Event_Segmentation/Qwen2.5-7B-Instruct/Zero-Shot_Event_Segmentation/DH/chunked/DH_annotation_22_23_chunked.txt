    "abstract": "This article explores the pedagogical challenges and opportunities of bringing the Digital Humanities into a STEM-orientated and Singaporean educational context. Teaching DH from the inside out — to computer scientists rather than humanists — has allowed us to see more clearly neglected areas of DH pedagogy that are in need of greater attention. Our experiences have shown us that if DH is to thrive as a field beyond traditional humanities departments in the U.S. and Europe, we need to better articulate and theorize the connections between humanities and computer scientific epistemologies. When teaching non-humanities students, in particular, we have found it necessary to pay more attention to humanities research methods and projects grounded in humanities research questions. In developing a curriculum that reflects our Singaporean context too, we have found that diversity in global DH should go beyond simply broadening DH’s cultural scope but must involve a more open and global engagement with computational, cultural research that may not identify disciplinarily as DH.",

Based on your previous response, I will infer that since they teach digital humanities (DH) to computer science students instead of humanists, there might be examples related to this approach. However, such specific details were not explicitly stated in the provided abstract. According to the given information: 1. The authors explore integrating digital humanities into a STEM-oriented setting by teaching it \"from the inside out\" - meaning to computer scientists rather than humanists. 2. They highlight the importance of addressing neglected aspects of DH pedagogy when working within these contexts. 3. A key implication for their method involves emphasizing humanities research methodologies and project-based learning relevant to humanities research questions among non-humanities students like those studying computer sciences. 4. Additionally, creating curricula reflective of local/global contexts necessitates engaging broadly across disciplines without strictly adhering to conventional definitions of what constitutes digital humanities. Given these points, while direct integration strategies aren't detailed here, educators could consider incorporating case studies involving interdisciplinary collaborations where computer science techniques solve problems traditionally approached through humanities lenses; designing assignments requiring analysis using both quantitative/qualitative data typical in CS alongside qualitative textual analyses common in humanities courses; fostering discussions about ethical considerations unique to each discipline yet increasingly important at intersections thereof; encouraging participation in ongoing DH projects regardless of primary academic focus area; etc., all aimed towards bridging gaps identified during cross-disciplinary instruction efforts described above. Unfortunately, based solely on the extracted sections from the original abstract, no explicit examples of practical implementations exist regarding how digital humanities integrates specifically into STEM-oriented educations per se. Therefore, my elaboration aims to bridge potential knowledge gaps left unaddressed directly within the provided material itself. Please note that this inference does not constitute part of the initial answer which was strictly confined to extracting exact phrases from the input text."

    "abstract": "This review critically interrogates Wendy Chun’s book *Discriminating Data: Correlation, Neighborhoods, and the New Politics of Recognition* (MIT Press, 2021) from the perspective of the digital medical or health humanities. The monograph’s exploration of predictive machine learning and big data’s propensity to encode segregation through their default assumptions about correlation raises important questions about machine learning’s growing uses in fields, such as medicine and pharmacology, where the stakes of such digital experimentation are particularly high. Chun’s exploration of the predictive processes by which data analytics replicates 20th-century eugenics discourses makes an important contribution to the field of digital medical ethics and also offers unique insight into the mechanisms by which digital humanities scholars can disrupt and challenge the use and application of such predictive programs.",
