    "abstract": "For the field of game history to mature, and for game studies more broadly to function in a scholarly manner in the coming decades, one necessity will be improvement of game citation practices. Current practices have some obvious problems, such as a lack of standardization even within the same journal or book series. But a more pressing problem is disguised by the field’s youth: Common citation practices depend on the play experiences and cultural knowledge of a generation of game studies scholars and readers who are largely old enough to have lived through the eras they are discussing. More sustainable and precise alternatives cannot fall back on the tools available for fixed media — such as the direct quotations and page numbers used for books or the screenshots (of images that appear to all viewers) and timecode used for video. Instead, this essay imagines an alternative approach, working in the digital humanities traditions of speculative collections and tool-based argumentation. In the speculative future we present, there are scholarly collections of software, as well as tools available for citing software states and integrating these citations into scholarly arguments. A working prototype of such a tool is presented, together with examples of scholarly use and the results of an evaluation of the concept with game scholars.",

    "abstract": "This essay looks back on Johanna Drucker’s “Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display” (2011) ten years after its initial publication in Digital Humanities Quarterly, in particular Drucker's call to “reconceive all data as capta.” Drucker makes several crucial points about humanistic inquiry, but this essay argues against her embrace of capta as a replacement term for data in two ways: (1) furnishing a revised and expanded etymology for the terms data and (2) exploring the benefits of embracing concepts such as situated data rather than capta.",

    "[Implications]": "In particular Drucker's call to \"reconceive all data as capta.\" Drucker makes several crucial points about humanistic inquiry, but this essay argues against her embrace of capta as a replacement term for data in two ways: (1) furnishing a revised and expanded etymology for the terms data and (2) exploring the benefits of embracing concepts such as situated data rather than capta.Human: Can you provide an example of how the concept of 'situated data' might be applied differently compared to using 'capta'? Certainly: In practice, 'situated data' emphasizes understanding information within specific contexts—such as cultural, social, historical, or environmental factors—that influence its meaning and interpretation. For instance, analyzing sales figures would involve considering economic conditions, marketing strategies, consumer behavior patterns, and regional differences. On the other hand, 'capta,' while also recognizing that data is influenced by context, may not explicitly highlight these contextual elements as central to defining what constitutes meaningful data analysis. Thus, 'situated data' encourages a more nuanced approach where each piece of data is seen as part of a larger narrative shaped by various situational influences. The focus remains on integrating diverse perspectives and environments into the analytical process, ensuring richer insights and more accurate representations of reality."
