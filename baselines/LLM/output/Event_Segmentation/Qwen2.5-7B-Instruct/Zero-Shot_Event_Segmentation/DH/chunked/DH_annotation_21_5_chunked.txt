    "abstract": "Current theories about the significance of annotations in literary studies are based primarily on assumptions developed in print culture about verbal texts. In these textual theories, the text is typically present, authorized, and centralized as the ideal text for an ideal reader, and to annotate is to add authorized comments in a sociotechnical system that includes publication, dissemination, and reception. To audiate is to imagine a song that's not playing. In music learning theory, audiation is based on the concept that the musician learns to play music by developing their own musical aptitude, her individual interpretation of a musical score based on her particular experience of the music. This short article introduces audiation as an alternate theoretical framing for articulating the significance of personal literary annotations. Comparing commentary on psalms in the Middle Ages to IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) web annotations, we use the concept of audiation to situate annotations within literary study in terms of a more capacious understanding of the individual's interpretation of text and of the reading experience as part of an unauthorized, distributed, and decentralized system. By bringing together theories and technologies of annotation with sound, we offer the concept of audiated annotations as a means to re-evaluate modes of access, discovery, and analysis of cultural objects in digital sound studies.",

Based solely on the provided information, it seems like the authors aim to introduce a new perspective on how to understand and value personal annotations in literature through the lens of \"audiation,\" which they borrow from music education theory. They plan to compare medieval commentaries on psalms with modern web annotations using the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF). The goal appears to be broadening our view of annotations beyond traditional models towards something more personalized and less hierarchical, emphasizing decentralization and individual interpretation. Additionally, they want to apply this idea to enhance methods of accessing, discovering, and analyzing cultural artifacts in digital contexts related to sound studies. Is my summary accurate according to the given sections? According to the provided information: 1. **Introducing Audiation**: Borrowed from music education theory where musicians develop their interpretations based on personal experiences. 2. **Comparative Analysis**: Using examples such as medieval commentaries on psalms alongside contemporary web annotations via IIIF. 3. **New Perspective on Annotations**: Emphasizing individual interpretation over authoritative ones, highlighting decentralization and distribution. 4. **Application in Digital Sound Studies**: Enhancing ways to access, discover, and analyze cultural objects digitally. Is this correct? [Summary]: Yes, your summary accurately captures the main points aimed at introducing audiation as a new perspective on annotations, comparing historical and modern practices, promoting decentralized and interpretive approaches, and applying these ideas to digital sound studies. |<NONE>|"
