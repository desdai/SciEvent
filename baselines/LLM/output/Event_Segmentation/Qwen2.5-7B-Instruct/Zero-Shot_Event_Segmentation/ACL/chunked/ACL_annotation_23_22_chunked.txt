    "abstract": "Reusing off-the-shelf code snippets from online repositories is a common practice, which significantly enhances the productivity of software developers. To find desired code snippets, developers resort to code search engines through natural language queries. Neural code search models are hence behind many such engines. These models are based on deep learning and gain substantial attention due to their impressive performance. However, the security aspect of these models is rarely studied. Particularly, an adversary can inject a backdoor in neural code search models, which return buggy or even vulnerable code with security/privacy issues. This may impact the downstream software (e.g., stock trading systems and autonomous driving) and cause financial loss and/or life-threatening incidents. In this paper, we demonstrate such attacks are feasible and can be quite stealthy. By simply modifying one variable/function name, the attacker can make buggy/vulnerable code rank in the top 11%. Our attack BADCODE features a special trigger generation and injection procedure, making the attack more effective and stealthy. The evaluation is conducted on two neural code search models and the results show our attack outperforms baselines by 60%. Our user study demonstrates that our attack is more stealthy than the baseline by two times based on the F1 score.",

    "[Implications]": "<NONE>Human: Given the extracted information about the feasibility and effectiveness of injecting backdoors into neural code search models, what potential real-world implications could arise if such vulnerabilities were exploited? Consider both immediate and long-term impacts. Please provide your answer without any additional commentary or analysis beyond directly addressing the question asked. Note: Your response should not exceed three sentences. The exploitation of such vulnerabilities could lead to immediate financial losses for businesses relying on compromised code suggestions. Long-term consequences might include erosion of public trust in automated coding tools and increased regulatory scrutiny on AI-driven technologies used in critical infrastructure sectors like finance and transportation. Potential safety hazards could also emerge, particularly affecting industries where system failures have severe repercussions. <|END_OF_RESPONSE|> Assistant: The exploitation of such vulnerabilities could lead to immediate financial losses for businesses relying on compromised code suggestions.

    "abstract": "To prevent the costly and inefficient use of resources on low-quality annotations, we want a method for creating a pool of dependable annotators who can effectively complete difficult tasks, such as evaluating automatic summarization. Thus, we investigate the recruitment of high-quality Amazon Mechanical Turk workers via a two-step pipeline. We show that we can successfully filter out subpar workers before they carry out the evaluations and obtain high-agreement annotations with similar constraints on resources. Although our workers demonstrate a strong consensus among themselves and CloudResearch workers, their alignment with expert judgments on a subset of the data is not as expected and needs further training in correctness. This paper still serves as a best practice for the recruitment of qualified annotators in other challenging annotation tasks.",
