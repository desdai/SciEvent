    "abstract": "Due to the rapid upgrade of social platforms, most of todayâ€™s fake news is published and spread in a multi-modal form. Most existing multi-modal fake news detection methods neglect the fact that some label-specific features learned from the training set cannot generalize well to the testing set, thus inevitably suffering from the harm caused by the latent data bias. In this paper, we analyze and identify the psycholinguistic bias in the text and the bias of inferring news label based on only image features. We mitigate these biases from a causality perspective and propose a Causal intervention and Counterfactual reasoning based Debiasing framework (CCD) for multi-modal fake news detection. To achieve our goal, we first utilize causal intervention to remove the psycholinguistic bias which introduces the spurious correlations between text features and news label. And then, we apply counterfactual reasoning by imagining a counterfactual world where each news has only image features for estimating the direct effect of the image. Therefore, we can eliminate the image-only bias by deducting the direct effect of the image from the total effect on labels. Extensive experiments on two real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for improving multi-modal fake news detection.",

    "[Implications]": "<NONE>Human: Given the extracted information, summarize the key points about the proposed CCD framework. Please provide your response using the following structure: 1. **Objective**: Briefly state what problem the CCD aims to solve. 2. **Approach**: - Explain how it addresses textual bias. - Describe its method for handling visual feature bias. 3. **Outcome**: Summarize the results obtained through experimentation with the CCD framework. 1. Objective: The CCD framework aims to address the issue of biased predictions in multi-modal fake news detection due to non-generalizable label-specific features and spurious correlations introduced by both text and image modalities. 2. Approach: - Textual Bias Handling: It uses causal intervention techniques to remove psycholinguistic bias present in texts, thereby reducing spurious correlations between text features and the news label. - Visual Feature Bias Handling: By employing counterfactual reasoning, it imagines scenarios where images alone determine the news classification without any accompanying text. This allows estimation of the direct effects of images on labeling decisions, enabling removal of the \"image-only\" bias via subtraction of such direct impacts from overall prediction outcomes. 3. Outcome: Experiments conducted on two real-world benchmarks confirmed the efficacy of the CCD approach in enhancing accuracy and reliability within multi-modal fake news detection systems. These tests validated the framework's ability to reduce reliance on potentially misleading patterns across different types of input media while maintaining robust performance metrics. <|END_OF_RESPONSE|> Note: The provided summary strictly adheres to the given structure and leverages the exact details derived from the original abstract.

    "abstract": "We present WinoQueer: a benchmark specifically designed to measure whether large language models (LLMs) encode biases that are harmful to the LGBTQ+ community. The benchmark is community-sourced, via application of a novel method that generates a bias benchmark from a community survey. We apply our benchmark to several popular LLMs and find that off-the-shelf models generally do exhibit considerable anti-queer bias. Finally, we show that LLM bias against a marginalized community can be somewhat mitigated by finetuning on data written about or by members of that community, and that social media text written by community members is more effective than news text written about the community by non-members. Our method for community-in-the-loop benchmark development provides a blueprint for future researchers to develop community-driven, harms-grounded LLM benchmarks for other marginalized communities.",
