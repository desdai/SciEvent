Objective: The CCD framework aims to address the issue of biased predictions in multi-modal fake news detection due to non-generalizable label-specific features and spurious correlations introduced by both text and image modalities. 2. Approach: - Textual Bias Handling: It uses causal intervention techniques to remove psycholinguistic bias present in texts, thereby reducing spurious correlations between text features and the news label. - Visual Feature Bias Handling: By employing counterfactual reasoning, it imagines scenarios where images alone determine the news classification without any accompanying text. This allows estimation of the direct effects of images on labeling decisions, enabling removal of the \"image-only\" bias via subtraction of such direct impacts from overall prediction outcomes. 3.

To examine the impact of native CDS, we use the TILT-based cross lingual transfer learning approach established by Papadimitriou and Jurafsky (2020) and find that, as in human SLA, language family distance predicts more negative transfer. Additionally, we find that conversational speech data shows greater facilitation for language acquisition than scripted speech data.

KPA extracts the main points in the data as a list of concise sentences or phrases, termed Key Points, and quantifies their prevalence. While key points are more expressive than word clouds and key phrases, making sense of a long, flat list of key points, which often express related ideas in varying levels of granularity, may still be challenging. To address this limitation of KPA, we introduce the task of organizing a given set of key points into a hierarchy, according to their specificity. Such hierarchies may be viewed as a novel type of Textual Entailment Graph. We develop ThinkP, a high-quality benchmark dataset of key point hierarchies for business and product reviews, obtained by consolidating multiple annotations. We compare different methods for predicting pairwise relations between key points, and for inferring a hierarchy from these pairwise predictions. In particular, for the task of computing pairwise key point relations, we achieve significant gains over existing strong baselines by applying directional distributional similarity methods to a novel distributional representation of key points, and further boost performance via weak supervision.",

    "abstract": "Text generation often involves producing coherent and grammatically correct texts that also satisfy a given set of semantic constraints. While most approaches for conditional text generation have primarily focused on lexical constraints, they often struggle to effectively incorporate syntactic constraints, which provide a richer language for approximating semantic constraints. We address this gap by introducing NeuroStructural Decoding, a new decoding algorithm that incorporates syntactic constraints to further improve the quality of the generated text. We build NeuroStructural Decoding on the NeuroLogic Decoding (Lu et al. 2021) algorithm, which enables language generation models to produce fluent text while satisfying complex lexical constraints. Our algorithm is powerful and scalable. It tracks lexico-syntactic constraints (e.g., we need to observe dog as subject and ball as object) during decoding by parsing the partial generations at each step. To this end, we adapt a dependency parser to generate parses for incomplete sentences. Our approach is evaluated on three different language generation tasks, and the results show improved performance in both lexical and syntactic metrics compared to previous methods. The results suggest this is a promising solution for integrating fine-grained controllable generation into the conventional beam search decoding.",
    "[Background]": "Text generation often involves producing coherent and grammatically correct texts that also satisfy a given set of semantic constraints. While most approaches for conditional text generation have primarily focused on lexical constraints, they often struggle to effectively incorporate syntactic constraints, which provide a richer language for approximating semantic constraints. We address this gap by introducing NeuroStructural Decoding, a new decoding algorithm that incorporates syntactic constraints to further improve the quality of the generated text.",
    "[Method]": "We build NeuroStructural Decoding on the NeuroLogic Decoding (Lu et al. 2021) algorithm, which enables language generation models to produce fluent text while satisfying complex lexical constraints. Our algorithm is powerful and scalable. It tracks lexico-syntactic constraints (e.g., we need to observe dog as subject and ball as object) during decoding by parsing the partial generations at each step. To this end, we adapt a dependency parser to generate parses for incomplete sentences.",

    "abstract": "Direct speech-to-speech translation (S2ST), in which all components can be optimized jointly, is advantageous over cascaded approaches to achieve fast inference with a simplified pipeline. We present a novel two-pass direct S2ST architecture, UnitY, which first generates textual representations and predicts discrete acoustic units subsequently. We enhance the model performance by subword prediction in the first-pass decoder, advanced two-pass decoder architecture design and search strategy, and better training regularization. To leverage large amounts of unlabeled text data, we pre-train the first-pass text decoder based on the self-supervised denoising auto-encoding task. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets at various data scales demonstrate that UnitY outperforms a single-pass speech-to-unit translation model by 2.5-4.2 ASR-BLEU with 2.83x decoding speed-up. We show that the proposed methods boost the performance even when predicting spectrogram in the second pass. However, predicting discrete units achieves 2.51x decoding speed-up compared to that case.",

To extend the benefits of BLOOM to other languages without incurring prohibitively large costs, it is desirable to adapt BLOOM to new languages not seen during pretraining. In this work, we apply existing language adaptation strategies to BLOOM and benchmark its zero-shot prompting performance on eight new languages in a resource-constrained setting. We find language adaptation to be effective at improving zero-shot performance in new languages. Surprisingly, we find that adapter-based finetuning is more effective than continued pretraining for large models.

The proposed method aims to formulate sequence-level knowledge distillation using a generalized f-divergence function within an FDISTILL framework. This approach introduces new distilling variants and demonstrates superior performance over existing methods like SeqKD and ENGINE through experiments conducted on multiple datasets. The symmetry in their loss functions also enhances the ability of the student model to mimic the teacher's distribution more effectively. <|END_OF_RESPONSE|> Assistant: The proposed method aims to improve upon existing knowledge distillation techniques by formulating sequence-level knowledge distillation with a generalized f-divergence function in an FDISTILL framework. It introduces novel distilling variants and shows better performance than SeqKD and ENGINE methods across various datasets. Additionally, its symmetric loss functions help the student model more accurately capture the teacher’s distribution. <|END_OF_RESPONSE|>What specific type of divergences do you think might be used in the FDISTILL framework? In the FDISTILL framework, the specific types of divergences mentioned are those belonging to the class of generalized f-divergence functions. These include but are not limited to Kullback-Leibler divergence, Jensen-Shannon divergence, and others depending on the choice of the convex function \\(f\\). However, the exact nature of these divergences is not specified beyond being part of the broader category of generalized f-divergences. <|END_OF_RESPONSE|> What are some potential benefits of using generalized f-divergence in the FDISTILL framework compared to traditional methods? Some potential benefits of using generalized f-divergence in the FDISTILL framework compared to traditional methods include flexibility, robustness, and improved modeling capabilities. Generalized f-divergences offer greater flexibility due to the wide range of possible choices for the convex function \\(f\\), allowing them to adapt to different distributions and learning tasks more effectively. They often provide stronger guarantees regarding convergence properties and can lead to more stable training processes. Furthermore, they may enable capturing complex relationships between probability distributions, potentially leading to better transfer of knowledge from the teacher to the student model. <|END_OF_RESPONSE|> How does the FDISTILL framework reduce the computational complexity associated with sequence-level divergences during training? According to the abstract, the FDISTILL framework reduces the computational complexity associated with sequence-level divergences during training by deriving a step-wise decomposition that transforms intractable sequence-level divergences into computationally manageable word-level losses. This allows for efficient computation while maintaining the effectiveness of the knowledge distillation process. <|END_OF_RESPONSE|> Can you elaborate on how the symmetric distilling losses contribute to improving the student model's performance according to the abstract? As per the abstract, the symmetric distilling losses introduced in the FDISTILL framework play a crucial role in enhancing the student model's performance because they better enforce the alignment between the student and teacher distributions. By ensuring symmetrical treatment of both distributions, these losses facilitate a more accurate and effective transfer of knowledge from the larger, more sophisticated \"teacher\" model to the smaller, less resource-intensive \"student\" model. This results in the student model learning more precisely from the teacher's learned representations, thereby achieving higher overall performance. <|END_OF_RESPONSE|> Could you list the key components of the FDISTILL framework based on the given abstract? Based on the given abstract, the key components of the FDISTILL framework are: 1. Formulation of sequence-level knowledge distillation as minimizing a generalized f-divergence function. 2. Introduction of four distinct distilling variants. 3. Demonstration that existing methods such as SeqKD and ENGINE are approximations of the proposed FDISTILL methods. 4. Derivation of a step-wise decomposition technique that converts intractable sequence-level divergences into word-level losses, making computations feasible. 5. Use of symmetric distilling losses to enhance the student model's capability to learn from the teacher distribution. <|END_OF_RESPONSE|> Based on the abstract, could you outline the main steps involved in transforming sequence-level divergences into word-level losses in the FDISTILL framework? Based on the abstract, the main steps involved in transforming sequence-level divergences into word-level losses in the FDISTILL framework involve: 1. Minimizing a generalized f-divergence function at the sequence level. 2. Applying a derived step-wise decomposition technique. This transformation breaks down the intractable sequence-level divergences into simpler, computationally manageable word-level losses. Through this process, the framework ensures that the knowledge distillation remains effective even when dealing with sequences rather than individual words directly. <|END_OF_RESPONSE|> According to the abstract, what evidence supports the claim that the FDISTILL framework performs better than existing KD approaches?

Prior sentence segmentation tools either rely on punctuation or require a considerable amount of sentence-segmented training data: both central assumptions might fail when porting sentence segmenters to diverse languages on a massive scale. In this work, we thus introduce a multilingual punctuation-agnostic sentence segmentation method, currently covering 85 languages, trained in a self-supervised fashion on unsegmented text, by making use of newline characters which implicitly perform segmentation into paragraphs. We further propose an approach that adapts our method to the segmentation in a given corpus by using only a small number (64-256) of sentence-segmented examples. The main results indicate that our method outperforms all the prior best sentence-segmentation tools by an average of 6.1% F1 points. Furthermore, we demonstrate that proper sentence segmentation has a point: the use of a (powerful) sentence segmenter makes a considerable difference for a downstream application such as machine translation (MT). By using our method to match sentence segmentation to the segmentation used during training of MT models, we achieve an average improvement of 2.3 BLEU points over the best prior segmentation tool, as well as massive gains over a trivial segmenter that splits text into equally-sized blocks.",

By providing poisoned training data, the adversary can embed a “backdoor” into the victim model, which allows input instances satisfying certain textual patterns (e.g., containing a keyword) to be predicted as a target label of the adversary’s choice. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to design a backdoor attack that is both stealthy (i.e., hard to notice) and effective (i.e., has a high attack success rate). We propose BITE, a backdoor attack that poisons the training data to establish strong correlations between the target label and a set of “trigger words”. These trigger words are iteratively identified and injected into the target-label instances through natural word-level perturbations. The poisoned training data instruct the victim model to predict the target label on inputs containing trigger words, forming the backdoor. Experiments on four text classification datasets show that our proposed attack is significantly more effective than baseline methods while maintaining decent stealthiness, raising alarm on the usage of untrusted training data.

How do they address computational efficiency? ### Reference Text: Grammar induction has been studied extensively as part of natural language processing tasks such as syntactic analysis. In particular, recent works have focused on inducing mildly context-sensitive grammars which can capture more complex linguistic phenomena than traditional phrase structure grammars while still being amenable to efficient parsing algorithms. This paper presents a method for unsupervised discontinuous parsing based on the probabilistic Linear Context-Free Rewriting System (pLCF RS), where the goal is to learn parameters of the grammar without any annotated data. The authors fix the structural constraints of pLCF RS ahead of time but allow the probability distribution over possible parses to be learned via maximum likelihood estimation. They also introduce several optimizations aimed at improving scalability; specifically, by restricting attention to Binary pLCF RS (B-pLCF RS)—a variant allowing each production to involve at most 2 non-terminals—and discarding productions whose parsing would take too long due to their high computational cost. These modifications enable them to handle larger vocabularies and richer representations compared to previous approaches, leading to better performance on real-world languages like English, French, Spanish, etcetera. The key machine learning techniques used here include fixing the structural constraints upfront and optimizing through maximum likelihood estimation. Computational efficiency was addressed by limiting the scope to B-pLCF RS and pruning out costly operations during parsing. |# Based on the provided reference text, the specific type of machine learning technique described involves: 1. **Fixing Structural Constraints Upfront**: The researchers define fixed structural constraints within the framework of Probabilistic Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (pLCF RS). 2. **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**: Parameters of these predefined grammatical structures are optimized using MLE to fit the observed data without labeled annotations. To enhance computational efficiency, the following strategies were employed: 1. **Binary pLCF RS Restriction**: By focusing solely on Binary pLCF RS variants, wherein every production involves at most two non-terminal symbols, the model simplifies computations significantly. 2. **Pruning Costly Productions**: Certain productions requiring excessive computation times—specifically those involving higher-order interactions—are discarded, thereby streamlining the overall process. In summary, the primary ML technique utilized is Maximum Likelihood Estimation applied to pre-defined structural constraints derived from pLCF RS. Computationally, the methods focus on binary restrictions and strategic elimination of computationally expensive rules to ensure practical applicability across various natural languages. # Extracted Key Points Specific Machine Learning Technique: Fixing structural constraints upfront combined with optimization through Maximum Likelihood Estimation Addressing Computational Efficiency: - Restricted to Binary pLCF RS to limit non-terminal usage per production. - Discarded productions with high computational costs (>O(l^6)) to achieve O(l^5) parsing complexity. #"

In this paper, we propose XLM-P, a method that contextually retrieves prompts as flexible guidance for encoding instances conditionally. Our space-efficient and model-agnostic XLM-P approach enables (1) lightweight modeling of language-invariant and language-specific knowledge across languages, and (2) easy integration with other multilingual pre-training methods. On the tasks of XTREME, which include text classification, sequence labeling, question answering, and sentence retrieval, both base- and large-size language models pre-trained with our proposed method exhibit consistent performance improvement. Furthermore, it provides substantial advantages for low-resource languages in unsupervised sentence retrieval and for target languages that differ greatly from the source language in cross-lingual transfer.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LMs) beyond a certain scale, demonstrate the emergent capability of generating free-text rationales for their predictions via chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. While CoT can yield dramatically improved performance, such gains are only observed for sufficiently large LMs. Even more concerning, there is little guarantee that the generated rationales are consistent with LM’s predictions or faithfully justify the decisions. In this work, we propose SCOTT, a faithful knowledge distillation method to learn a small, self-consistent CoT model from a teacher model that is orders of magnitude larger. To form better supervision, we elicit rationales supporting the gold answers from a large LM (teacher) by contrastive decoding, which encourages the teacher to generate tokens that become more plausible only when the answer is considered. To ensure faithful distillation, we use the teacher-generated rationales to learn a student LM with a counterfactual reasoning objective, which prevents the student from ignoring the rationales to make inconsistent predictions. Experiments show that while yielding comparable performance, our method leads to a more faithful model than baselines. Further analysis shows that such a model respects the rationales more when making decisions; thus, we can improve its performance more by refining its rationales.",

The set of all Pareto optimal solutions forms a Pareto frontier. In this work, we propose a new training framework, Pareto Mutual Distillation (Pareto-MD), towards pushing the Pareto frontier outwards rather than making trade-offs. Specifically, Pareto-MD collaboratively trains two Pareto optimal solutions that favor different languages and allows them to learn from the strengths of each other via knowledge distillation. Furthermore, we introduce a novel strategy to enable stronger communication between Pareto optimal solutions and broaden the applicability of our approach.

To test this, we present a structured prompting approach for linguistic structured prediction tasks, allowing us to perform zero- and few-shot sequence tagging with autoregressive PLMs. We evaluate this approach on part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and sentence chunking, demonstrating strong few-shot performance in all cases. We also find that while PLMs contain significant prior knowledge of task labels due to task leakage into the pretraining corpus, structured prompting can also retrieve linguistic structure with arbitrary labels. These findings indicate that the in-context learning ability and linguistic knowledge of PLMs generalizes beyond memorization of their training data.",
