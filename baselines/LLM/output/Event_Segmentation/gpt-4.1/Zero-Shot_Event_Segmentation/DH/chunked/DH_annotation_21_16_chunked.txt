    "abstract": "The aim of this article is to present a model for representing in an explicit and formal way the diachronic evolution of concepts and terms in a given domain, so that this formalization can be machine-actionable. The approach we here propose is based on Semantic Web technologies in order to guarantee interoperability and reuse across scientific communities of diachronic terminological resources that can be thus easily accessed, interconnected and mutually enriched. More specifically, the representation of dynamic evolution of terms and concepts was performed in OWL using the N-ary relations mechanisms. In addition, a set of SWRL rules was set up, in order to automatically identify the evolution of the concepts evoked within a text, as well as the terms representing these concepts. Our model was adopted to formally represent diachronic aspects of Saussure’s terminology as they emerge from his works. An example will be provided to highlight the potential of such a knowledge structuration for gaining a wider understanding of the profound terminological and conceptual changes brought about by the paradigmatic and epistemological revolutions in sciences.",

    "abstract": "In this essay, we trace our early and ongoing development in creating a digital critical edition of J. Hector St. Jean de Crèvecoeur’s Letters from an American Farmer. We discuss our shift from print to digital publishing technologies and outline the challenges and lessons learned as two senior faculty members starting out in the digital humanities. The essay not only addresses our process in developing the digital edition but also our various experiences piloting the edition with our students. In several brief case studies, we analyze the value of integrating print vs. digital mediums into the classroom as well as our efforts to transfer editorial control over to our students, using the digital to teach them how to become curators of text.",
