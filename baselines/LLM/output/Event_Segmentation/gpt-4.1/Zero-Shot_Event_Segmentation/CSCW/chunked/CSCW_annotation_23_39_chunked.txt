    "abstract": "Social media platforms are being utilized by individuals with mental illness for engaging in self-disclosure, finding support, or navigating treatment journeys. Individuals also increasingly bring their social media data to psychotherapy consultations. This emerging practice during psychotherapy can help us to better understand how patients appropriate social media technologies to develop and iterate patient narratives — the stories of patients' own experiences that are vital in mental health treatment. In this paper, we seek to understand patients' perspectives regarding why and how they bring up their social media activities during psychotherapy consultations as well as related concerns. Through interviews with 18 mood disorder patients, we found that social media helps augment narratives around interpersonal conflicts, digital detox, and self-expression. We also found that discussion of social media activities shines a light on the power imbalance and privacy concerns regarding use of patient-generated health information. Based on the findings, we discuss that social media data are different from other types of patient-generated health data in terms of supporting patient narratives because of the social interactions and curation social media inherently engenders. We also discuss privacy concerns and trust between a patient and a therapist when patient narratives are supported by patients' social media data. Finally, we suggest design implications for social computing technologies that can foster patient narratives rooted in social media activities.",

    "abstract": "Legal crowdfunding is an emerging domain where lawyers and individuals raise funds to fight legal actions. To study how prospective donors can verify the credibility of legal campaigns, we analyzed the conversations surrounding these campaigns on Facebook. We discovered three primary themes associated with the perceptions of the contributors of legal campaigns: supporters posting admiring and appreciative comments, supporters posting critical and disapproving comments, and opponents posting critical and disapproving comments. We observed that while supporters criticized campaigns' opponents, biased media, and dishonest authorities, opponents criticized campaign owners, campaigns' objectives and opaque logistics. To understand the impact of these perspectives on donors, we followed up with an online survey study where we presented a legal campaign with its corresponding social media conversations. We found that critical comments impacted donation decisions more than appreciative comments. We concluded with design implications to better support potential donors to make more informed donation decisions.",
