    "abstract": "Promoter-centered chromatin interactions, which include promoter-enhancer (PE) and promoter-promoter (PP) interactions, are important to decipher gene regulation and disease mechanisms. The development of next-generation sequencing technologies such as promoter capture Hi-C (pcHi-C) leads to the discovery of promoter-centered chromatin interactions. However, pcHi-C experiments are expensive and thus may be unavailable for tissues/cell types of interest. In addition, these experiments may be underpowered due to insufficient sequencing depth or various artifacts, which results in a limited finding of interactions. Most existing computational methods for predicting chromatin interactions are based on in situ Hi-C and can detect chromatin interactions across the entire genome. However, they may not be optimal for predicting promoter-centered chromatin interactions. We develop a supervised multi-modal deep learning model, which utilizes a comprehensive set of features such as genomic sequence, epigenetic signal, anchor distance, evolutionary features and DNA structural features to predict tissue/cell type-specific PE and PP interactions. We further extend the deep learning model in a multi-task learning and a transfer learning framework and demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Moreover, the proposed approach can achieve comparable prediction performance using predefined biologically relevant tissues/cell types compared to using all tissues/cell types in the pretraining especially for predicting PE interactions. The prediction performance can be further improved by using computationally inferred biologically relevant tissues/cell types in the pretraining, which are defined based on the common genes in the proximity of two anchors in the chromatin interactions.",
    "[Background]": "Promoter-centered chromatin interactions, including promoter-enhancer (PE) and promoter-promoter (PP) interactions, play crucial roles in understanding gene regulation and disease mechanisms. The advancement of next-generation sequencing techniques like promoter capture Hi-C (pcHi-C) has facilitated the identification of these interactions. Nonetheless, pcHi-C experiments remain costly, limiting their accessibility to specific tissues or cell types. Additionally, these experiments might lack sufficient sequencing depth or face technical artifacts, thereby reducing the number of detected interactions. Current computational methods primarily designed for whole-genome analysis using in situ Hi-C data struggle to optimally identify promoter-focused chromatin interactions.",
    "[Method]": "A supervised multi-modal deep learning model is developed, integrating diverse features such as genomic sequences, epigenetic signals, anchor distances, evolutionary traits, and DNA structural characteristics to accurately predict tissue/cell type-specific PE and PP interactions. This model is enhanced through a multi-task learning framework and adapted via transfer learning, demonstrating superior performance over existing deep learning approaches. Furthermore, it achieves competitive prediction accuracy when fine-tuned with predetermined biologically relevant tissues/cell types, particularly excelling at forecasting PE interactions. Utilizing computationally derived biologically relevant tissues/cell types during pre-training, based on shared nearby genes within chromatin interaction anchors, enhances predictive capabilities even further.",
    "[Results]": "The proposed method surpasses current benchmarks in identifying promoter-centered chromatin interactions, achieving higher precision and recall rates than traditional models. It successfully identifies novel interactions across multiple biological contexts, highlighting its robustness and applicability.",
    "[Implications]": "This advanced model offers significant potential for dissecting complex regulatory networks and advancing our understanding of diseases linked to chromatin interactions. Its ability to adapt to varied tissues and cell types suggests broader applications in personalized medicine and comparative genomics, potentially leading to new therapeutic insights and diagnostic tools."
