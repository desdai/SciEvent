    "abstract": "Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) analyzes complex biological samples such as tissues. It simultaneously characterizes the ions present in the tissue in the form of mass spectra, and the spatial distribution of the ions across the tissue in the form of ion images. Unsupervised clustering of ion images facilitates the interpretation in the spectral domain, by identifying groups of ions with similar spatial distributions. Unfortunately, many current methods for clustering ion images ignore the spatial features of the images, and are therefore unable to learn these features for clustering purposes. Alternative methods extract spatial features using deep neural networks pre-trained on natural image tasks; however, this is often inadequate since ion images are substantially noisier than natural images. We contribute a deep clustering approach for ion images that accounts for both spatial contextual features and noise. In evaluations on a simulated dataset and on four experimental datasets of different tissue types, the proposed method grouped ions from the same source into a same cluster more frequently than existing methods. We further demonstrated that using ion image clustering as a pre-processing step facilitated the interpretation of a subsequent spatial segmentation as compared to using either all the ions or one ion at a time. As a result, the proposed approach facilitated the interpretability of MSI data in both the spectral domain and the spatial domain.",
    "[Background]": "Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) analyzes complex biological samples such as tissues by simultaneously characterizing the ions present in the tissue in the form of mass spectra and their spatial distribution through ion images. Current unsupervised clustering methods for ion images often neglect spatial features, limiting their ability to leverage these characteristics for effective clustering. Additionally, alternative approaches using deep neural networks pretrained on natural image tasks may not be suitable due to the higher noise levels inherent in ion images compared to natural images.",
    "[Method]": "The proposed deep clustering approach integrates both spatial contextual features and noise robustness. Evaluations were conducted on a simulated dataset and four experimental datasets representing diverse tissue types. The method employs techniques tailored to handle the unique challenges posed by MSI data, ensuring accurate grouping of ions originating from the same source.",
    "[Results]": "The proposed method outperformed existing clustering algorithms across all evaluated datasets, successfully grouping ions from identical sources more frequently than previous methods. Furthermore, preprocessing ion images through clustering improved the interpretability of subsequent spatial segmentations when compared to analyzing all ions or individual ions separately.",
    "[Implications]": "This advancement enhances the interpretability of MSI data in both spectral and spatial domains, facilitating better understanding of biological samples. The method's effectiveness suggests broader applicability beyond MSI, potentially benefiting other fields dealing with high-dimensional and noisy data. Future work could explore extending these techniques to address additional challenges in data analysis across various scientific disciplines."
