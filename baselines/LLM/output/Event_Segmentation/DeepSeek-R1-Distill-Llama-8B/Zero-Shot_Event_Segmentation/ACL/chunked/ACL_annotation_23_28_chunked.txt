    "abstract": "The ability of commonsense reasoning (CR) decides whether a neural machine translation (NMT) model can move beyond pattern recognition. Despite the rapid advancement of NMT and the use of pretraining to enhance NMT models, research on CR in NMT is still in its infancy, leaving much to be explored in terms of effectively training NMT models with high CR abilities and devising accurate automatic evaluation metrics. This paper presents a comprehensive study aimed at expanding the understanding of CR in NMT. For the training, we confirm the effectiveness of incorporating pretrained knowledge into NMT models and subsequently utilizing these models as robust testbeds for investigating CR in NMT. For the evaluation, we propose a novel entity-aware evaluation method that takes into account both the NMT candidate and important entities in the candidate, which is more aligned with human judgement. Based on the strong testbed and evaluation methods, we identify challenges in training NMT models with high CR abilities and suggest directions for further unlabeled data utilization and model design. We hope that our methods and findings will contribute to advancing the research of CR in NMT.",
    "[Background]": "The ability of commonsense reasoning (CR) determines whether a neural machine translation (NMT) model can go beyond pattern recognition. Although NMT has advanced rapidly and uses pretraining to improve models, research on CR in NMT remains underdeveloped, leaving many areas unexplored regarding effective training of NMT models with high CR capabilities and establishing reliable automatic evaluation metrics.",
    "[Method]": "For training, we validate the efficiency of integrating pre-trained knowledge into NMT models and then using these trained models as sturdy testing platforms to investigate CR in NMT. For evaluation, we introduce an innovative entity-aware evaluation approach that considers both the NMT candidate and significant entities within it, aligning more closely with human judgment.",
    "[Results]": "Using this solid framework and evaluation methods, we identified challenges in training NMT models with high CR abilities and suggested potential avenues for enhancing them through additional unlabeled data usage and improved model designs.",
    "[Implications]": "Our techniques and findings aim to advance research on CR in NMT, contributing to better understanding and application of such technologies."

    "abstract": "A series of datasets and models have been proposed for summaries generated for well-formatted documents such as news articles. Dialogue summaries, however, have been under explored. In this paper, we present the first dataset with fine-grained factual error annotations named DIASUMFACT. We define fine-grained factual error detection as a sentence-level multi-label classification problem, and weevaluate two state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on our dataset. Both models yield sub-optimal results, with a macro-averaged F1 score of around 0.25 over 6 error classes. We further propose an unsupervised model ENDERANKER via candidate ranking using pretrained encoder-decoder models. Our model performs on par with the SOTA models while requiring fewer resources. These observations confirm the challenges in detecting factual errors from dialogue summaries, which call for further studies, for which our dataset and results offer a solid foundation.",
