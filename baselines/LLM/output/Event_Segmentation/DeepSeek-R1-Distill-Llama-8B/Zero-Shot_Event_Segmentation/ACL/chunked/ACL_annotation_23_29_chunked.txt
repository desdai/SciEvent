    "abstract": "Classic approaches to content moderation typically apply a rule-based heuristic approach to flag content. While rules are easily customizable and intuitive for humans to interpret, they are inherently fragile and lack the flexibility or robustness needed to moderate the vast amount of undesirable content found online today. Recent advances in deep learning have demonstrated the promise of using highly effective deep neural models to overcome these challenges. However, despite the improved performance, these data-driven models lack transparency and explainability, often leading to mistrust from everyday users and a lack of adoption by many platforms. In this paper, we present Rule By Example (RBE): a novel exemplar-based contrastive learning approach for learning from logical rules for the task of textual content moderation. RBE is capable of providing rule-grounded predictions, allowing for more explainable and customizable predictions compared to typical deep learning-based approaches. We demonstrate that our approach is capable of learning rich rule embedding representations using only a few data examples. Experimental results on 3 popular hate speech classification datasets show that RBE is able to outperform state-of-the-art deep learning classifiers as well as the use of rules in both supervised and unsupervised settings while providing explainable model predictions via rule-grounding.",

    "[Implications]": "The implications of this work include advancing content moderation techniques with enhanced transparency and explainability, potentially increasing user trust and platform adoption rates. Additionally, RBE provides a flexible framework for developing customizable moderation rules, which could be adapted across various domains beyond hate speech detection. Future work may explore the application of RBE to other types of harmful or inappropriate content and investigate its scalability to larger datasets."

    "abstract": "Monolingual word alignment is crucial to model semantic interactions between sentences. In particular, null alignment, a phenomenon in which words have no corresponding counterparts, is pervasive and critical in handling semantically divergent sentences. Identification of null alignment is useful on its own to reason about the semantic similarity of sentences by indicating there exists information inequality. To achieve unbalanced word alignment that values both alignment and null alignment, this study shows that the family of optimal transport (OT), i.e., balanced, partial, and unbalanced OT, are natural and powerful approaches even without tailor-made techniques. Our extensive experiments covering unsupervised and supervised settings indicate that our generic OT-based alignment methods are competitive against the state-of-the-arts specially designed for word alignment, remarkably on challenging datasets with high null alignment frequencies.",

    "[Results]": "The main finding is that OT-based methods effectively handle unbalanced word alignment while considering null alignments, outperforming existing specialized models particularly when dealing with high rates of missing correspondences.",
    "[Implications]": "These results suggest that OT provides a versatile framework for word alignment tasks, balancing computational efficiency with semantic interpretability. Future research could explore hybrid models combining OT with other alignment strategies to further enhance performance across diverse linguistic scenarios."
