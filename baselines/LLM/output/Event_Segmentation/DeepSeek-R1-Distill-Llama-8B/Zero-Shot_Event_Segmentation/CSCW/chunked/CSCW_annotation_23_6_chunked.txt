    "abstract": "Youth regularly use technology driven by artificial intelligence (AI). However, it is increasingly well-known that AI can cause harm on small and large scales, especially for those underrepresented in tech fields. Recently, users have played active roles in surfacing and mitigating harm from algorithmic bias. Despite being frequent users of AI, youth have been under-explored as potential contributors and stakeholders to the future of AI. We consider three notions that may be at the root of youth facing barriers to playing an active role in responsible AI, which are youth (1) cannot understand the technical aspects of AI, (2) cannot understand the ethical issues around AI, and (3) need protection from serious topics related to bias and injustice. In this study, we worked with youth (N = 30) in first through twelfth grade and parents (N = 6) to explore how youth can be part of identifying algorithmic bias and designing future systems to address problematic technology behavior. We found that youth are capable of identifying and articulating algorithmic bias, often in great detail. Participants suggested different ways users could give feedback for AI that reflects their values of diversity and inclusion. Youth who may have less experience with computing or exposure to societal structures can be supported by peers or adults with more of this knowledge, leading to critical conversations about fairer AI. This work illustrates youths' insights, suggesting that they should be integrated in building a future of responsible AI.",
    "[Background]": "Youths regular use of technology driven by artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly common, yet concerns arise about its potential harms, particularly against those underrepresented in tech fields. Users have actively contributed to identifying and mitigating these issues, but the role of youth as contributors and stakeholders in AI's future remains underexplored. Three key challenges were identified: youth may lack understanding of AI's technical aspects, struggle with ethical considerations, and require protection from discussions involving bias and injustice. A study was conducted with 30 youth aged 10â€“12 and their parents to examine how youth can participate in detecting algorithmic bias and designing ethical AI systems.",
    "[Method]": "The study involved working with participants to explore their abilities in identifying biases within existing AI systems and proposing solutions. Data collection included interviews and focus groups with both youth and parents to gain insights into their perspectives and experiences regarding AI ethics and usage.",
    "[Results]": "Results indicated that youth possess significant capability in recognizing and explaining instances of algorithmic bias. They proposed various mechanisms for providing user feedback to ensure AI systems reflect values of diversity and inclusion. Additionally, it was observed that younger participants without extensive computational expertise could benefit from support through peer interactions or guidance from knowledgeable adults, fostering important discussions about equitable AI design.",
    "[Implications]": "These findings suggest that integrating youth voices into AI development processes can lead to more inclusive and responsible technologies. Future efforts should focus on creating platforms where young people can contribute effectively while ensuring their safety and comfort when discussing complex ethical issues related to AI."

    "abstract": "The global population of refugees as recorded by UNHCR is at an all-time high of over 90 million people forced to find new homes in a foreign land. Starting a new life can be unsettling for refugees and asylum seekers during the resettling process in their host countries, particularly when it comes to gaining financial independence. This paper used an interview-based study to engage with fifteen refugees and asylum seekers to learn how they achieve entrepreneurial success as they navigate refugee specific barriers in a new economy. The insights showed refugee entrepreneur specific barriers that align with resettlement challenges and the technical and social resourcefulness of this under-resourced community. Our contributions to the CSCW research community are an understanding of how low-socioeconomic entrepreneurs such as refugees, function in their ecosystem and design implications for developing technology to further the efforts of refugee entrepreneurs.",
