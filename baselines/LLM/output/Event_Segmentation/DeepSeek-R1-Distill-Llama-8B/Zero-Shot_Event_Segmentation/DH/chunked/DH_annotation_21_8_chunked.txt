    "abstract": "Digitization has changed flow music radio. Competition from music streaming services like Spotify and iTunes has to a large extent outperformed traditional playlist radio, and the global dissemination of software-generated playlists in public service radio stations in the 1990s has superseded the passionate music radio host. But digitization has also changed the way we can do research in radio. In Denmark, digitization of almost all radio programming back to 1989 has made it possible to actually listen to the archive to investigate how radio content has changed historically. This article investigates the research question: How has the distribution of music and talk on the Danish Broadcasting Corporation’s radio channel P3 developed 1989-2019 by comparing a qualitative case study with a new large-scale study. Methodologically, this shift from a close listening to a few programs to large-scale distant listening to more than 65,000 hours of radio enables us to discuss and critically compare the methods, results, strengths, and shortcomings of the two analyses. Previous studies have demonstrated that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained for image recognition of spectrograms of the audio outperform alternative approaches, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The large-scale study presented shows that the CNN-based approach generalizes well, even without fine-tuning, to speech and music classification in Danish radio, with an overall accuracy of 98%.",
    "[Background]": "Digitization has changed the landscape of music radio. Traditional playlist radio faces significant competition from music streaming platforms like Spotify and iTunes, which have largely surpassed traditional radio in popularity. Additionally, the widespread adoption of software-generated playlists in public service radio stations during the 1990s has diminished the role of the passionate music radio host.",
    "[Method]": "This study employs a combination of qualitative case studies and large-scale analysis to examine the evolution of music and talk content on the Danish Broadcasting Corporation’s radio channel P3 from 1989 to 2019. A shift from close listening to select programs to distant listening of over 65,000 hours of radio data is utilized to evaluate methodological advancements and assess the comparative effectiveness of different analytical approaches.",
    "[Results]": "The investigation reveals that convolutional neural networks (CNNs), traditionally used for image recognition tasks involving audio spectograms, achieve superior performance compared to other techniques like support vector machines (SVMs). The large-scale dataset demonstrates robust generalizability of the CNN-based model across various categories of speech and music, achieving an overall accuracy rate of 98%.",
    "[Implications]": "These findings underscore the transformative potential of AI-driven methodologies in media research, particularly in analyzing vast amounts of historical and contemporary audio data. The high accuracy rates suggest that advanced computational models can reliably categorize and analyze complex audio content, offering valuable insights into programmatic shifts within media landscapes."

    "abstract": "This article proposes an approach to designing project-based, credit-bearing digital humanities internships, based on experiences engaging students with digital projects affiliated with the Digital Humanities Institute at the University of North Florida. The author reviews recent scholarship on experiential learning and DH pedagogy, and considers why digital humanities internships are valuable for students, faculty, and institutions. The article outlines three general types of DH internships, providing examples for each, and suggesting possible student learning outcomes and a general course structure. The institutional factors necessary to make such experiences possible are also examined.",
