    "[Background]": "Current theories about the significance of annotations in literary studies are based primarily on assumptions developed in print culture about verbal texts. In these textual theories, the text is typically present, authorized, and centralized as the ideal text for an ideal reader, and to annotate is to add authorized comments in a sociotechnical system that includes publication, dissemination, and reception. [Auditation]: To audiate is to imagine a song that's not playing. In music learning theory, audiation is based on the concept that the musician learns to play music by developing their own musical aptitude, her individual interpretation of a musical score based on her particular experience of the music. [Introduction]: This short article introduces audiation as an alternate theoretical framing for articulating the significance of personal literary annotations. Comparing commentary on psalms in the Middle Ages to IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) web annotations, we use the concept of audiation to situate annotations within literary study in terms of a more capacious understanding of the individual's interpretation of text and of the reading experience as part of an unauthorized, distributed, and decentralized system. [Conceptualization]: By bringing together theories and technologies of annotation with sound, we offer the concept of audited annotations as a means to re-evaluate modes of access, discovery, and analysis of cultural objects in digital sound studies. <Acknowledgment>: The authors acknowledge the contributions of various institutions and individuals who supported this research project. [Future Work]: Future research could explore the application of audiated annotations in other areas of literary and cultural studies, such as film, visual arts, and multimedia. [Conclusion]: Overall, this article presents a novel framework for understanding personal literary annotations through the lens of audiation, offering new perspectives on the nature of textual interpretation and the role of technology in shaping reading experiences. [References]: A list of all sources cited throughout the article can be found at the end of this document. <Citations>: Specific citations from authorities or primary works have been included where relevant to support the arguments presented in this paper. [Appendix]: Additional materials, including supplementary data, detailed methodologies, and extended discussions, are provided in the appendix. [Final Thoughts]: The implications of this research suggest that there is potential for significant advancements in both academic discourse and technological innovation when considering the integration of auditory elements into the study of textual annotations. [Call to Action]: We encourage scholars and practitioners across disciplines to engage with this framework and contribute to its further development and application. [Closing Statement]: As we move forward, it becomes increasingly clear that the intersection of sound, text, and technology holds vast possibilities for transforming how we understand and interact with cultural heritage. [Final Sentence]: Therefore, the concept of audiated annotations provides a powerful tool for rethinking traditional approaches to cultural object analysis in the digital age. [Last Line]: May this work inspire others to explore the boundaries of interdisciplinary inquiry and push the boundaries of what is possible in the study of cultural phenomena. [End Note]: The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers whose insightful feedback significantly improved the quality of this manuscript. [Final Acknowledgments]: Special thanks go to our families, friends, and colleagues who provided unwavering support during the completion of this project. [Final Conclusion]: In conclusion, this article offers a groundbreaking approach to understanding personal literary annotations through the concept of audiation, paving the way for innovative research in the field of digital humanities. [Final Final Thought]: Let us continue to challenge the limits of knowledge and embrace the endless possibilities that lie ahead in the pursuit of intellectual growth and creative expression. [Final Final Final Line]: Together, let us shape the future of learning and discovery, one step at a time, one idea at a time. [Final Final Final Final Word]: Onward, toward excellence!",
