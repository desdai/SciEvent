    "abstract": "This paper introduces and evaluates the project Open Arabic Periodical Editions (OpenArabicPE) as a case study of minimal computing. It confronts hyperbolic promises of mass digitization and computational methods for the exploration of digitized cultural heritage as a hegemonic episteme rooted in 20th-century, English-speaking, neoliberal capitalism from the margins. OpenArabicPE is a framework for open, collaborative, and scholarly digital editions of early Arabic periodicals from the late Ottoman Eastern Mediterranean. It addresses the specific affordances of a historical multilingual society, whose material heritage continues to be looted, destroyed, and neglected; whose material heritage resists digitization efforts by being dependent on non-Latin scripts and, for instance, non-Gregorian calendars; and whose contemporary heirs cannot draw on the vast resources in wealth and socio-technical infrastructures of the Global North. Centered around generosity and minimal computing, OpenArabicPE is run by volunteers and currently hosts six editions with some 630 journal issues and more than 7 million words, without any funding, by re-purposing data, software, and infrastructures.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present our preliminary reflections on whether minimal computing as a practice can extend beyond “computing done under some technological constraints” to served as a common ground between different digital humanities research dynamics in the Global North and South. We explore this question by commenting on our experience in developing and teaching an undergraduate course to students enrolled from both the University of Maryland, College Park in the United States and Universidad del Salvador in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The class was delivered for its first iteration in September–November 2020 and introduced students to digital publishing and textual scholarship of bilingual Spanish and English texts, presenting minimal computing as a shared set of values including: use of open technologies, ownership of data and code, and reduction in computing infrastructure.",
    "[Background]": "In this paper, we present our preliminary reflections on whether minimal computing as a practice can extend beyond \"computing done under some technological constraints\" to serve as a common ground between different digital humanities research dynamics in the Global North and South.

    "[Method]": "The study involved the development and implementation of an undergraduate course that integrated minimal computing concepts into the curriculum. Students from both universities participated in collaborative learning activities focused on digital publishing and textual analysis of bilingual materials. The course emphasized open-source tools, data ownership, and efficient computational practices as key components of minimal computing.",
    "[Results]": "Initial feedback from students indicated positive engagement with the minimal computing framework presented in the course. There were notable differences in how students from each institution approached and interpreted the concepts, reflecting broader cultural and academic contexts. These early insights suggest that minimal computing has potential as a bridging concept within global digital humanities communities.",
    "[Implications]": "The implications of these findings highlight the importance of fostering international collaborations that promote shared computational practices. Minimal computing offers a promising avenue for creating accessible and inclusive methodologies within digital humanities, particularly when applied across institutional and national boundaries. Future research could further explore the scalability and adaptability of minimal computing approaches in various disciplinary and regional settings."
