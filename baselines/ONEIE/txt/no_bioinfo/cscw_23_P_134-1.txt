In this work, we study human decision-making behavior and task performance under time pressure — induced from limited initial observation time (time to perform the task before providing an initial response without AI input) and final decision time (time to weigh an AI's suggestion before reaching a collective human-AI team answer) — for spatial reasoning and count estimation tasks.
