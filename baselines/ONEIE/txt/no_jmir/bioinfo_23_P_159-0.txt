Protein and peptide engineering has become an essential field in biomedicine with therapeutics, diagnostics and synthetic biology applications. Helices are both abundant structural feature in proteins and comprise a major portion of bioactive peptides. Precise design of helices for binding or biological activity is still a challenging problem.
