Overall, most users positively rated the intervention regarding safety, content, and suiting their needs, especially participants from the intervention study arm. The intervention was helpful in the domains of acknowledgment, awareness, and support. However, participants also identified points for improvement: the availability of a simplified version for acute situations; more attention for survivors in the aftermath of ending an abusive relationship; and more information on certain topics, such as technological IPVA, support for children, and legal affairs. Furthermore, although participants expressed a prominent need for interactive contact options such as a chat or forum, the intervention study arm (the only group that had these features at their disposal) mainly used them in a passive way â€” reading instead of actively joining the conversation. The participants provided various reasons for this passive use.
